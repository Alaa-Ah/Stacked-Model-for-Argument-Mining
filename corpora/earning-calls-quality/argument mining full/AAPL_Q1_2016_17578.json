Thank you. I have a question, a follow-up, please. To start, just on iPhones, it looks like your guidance implies about a 15% to 20% unit decline in iPhones for fiscal Q2, which I think, unless you really see a change in demand profile in the second half, suggests that iPhone units will decline year-over-year for fiscal 2016. And I'd like you to address that question, because the obvious follow-up questions are is that because you believe the smartphone market won't grow or because Apple may be reaching saturation in the market? Is that because Apple's replacement cycle accelerated last year and is decelerating this year and that's why we'll see a decline in units? Or is there something about Apple's ability to gain share in a market where the market is moving to much lower price points? But I'm wondering, and Tim, maybe you're best to answer it, if you can address what appears likely to be a decline in iPhone units and how we put that in the context of how we should think about that, given some healthy data around switchers that you highlighted.", "start": 76, "labels": ["QUESTION"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 1153, "text": "Tim Cook", "start": 1144, "labels": ["REPRESENTATIVE"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 2080, "text": ": Toni, we do think that iPhone units will decline in the quarter.
