azg9-XskGm CLAIM-Opinion(view) 962 1081 Yes, I think that's a fair interpretation of my commentary both last year and this, which really speaks to consistency.
7A9Fu0UO-R PREMISE-Fact 1082 1343 I do believe that the market that which we are operating, the set of assets we've picked, the team we've built, the investments we made in our sales force, even some extent the acquisitions we've done, these are all showing up as top line revenue growth for us.
ToUivVo9MZ PREMISE-Fact 1344 1368 You see it this quarter.
DJS839vi5I PREMISE-Fact 1369 1401 You see it frankly in the guide.
BDAeV_dJMf PREMISE-Fact 1402 1533 And I think your interpretation that our focus on being a growth company, even at our scale, is certainly the right interpretation.
