t3Ml83AJU_ NON-ARG 681 754 Let me -- I think in general, let me start by saying all -- all up right.
rqovzSSh_w CLAIM-Opinion(view) 755 978 So in our commercial business, I think we’ve done a very good job of continuing to outpace IT spend on an overall basis by continuing to push customers to our annuity business whether they are on -- on premise or the cloud.
XsZysvgVvE CLAIM-Fact 979 1042 That is our strategic goal as well as impacts in both segments.
J6a7O92TCS NON-ARG 1043 1129 Now let me talk about sort of uniquely commercial licensing and how to think about it.
pesDZgjKd2 NON-ARG 1130 1238 While I won’t give specific guidance, I will talk about how to think about the impact in particular from XP.
1ex-DlLeLU CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1239 1294 Our transactional revenue will have a headwind from XP.
rv_rcXTrVD NON-ARG 1295 1497 That doesn’t and shouldn’t be interpreted as customers not continuing to be committed or not committing to move to annuity over the longer term, which is exactly I think the question that you're asking.
_JpkV2sgJQ PREMISE-Fact 1498 1706 And so while we have a comparability issue that will show itself most directly as weakness in commercial licensing and most specifically as weakness in Office transactional licensing which will be a headwind,
XsKmBH02SP NON-ARG 1707 1999 the overall goal of continuing to have more customers every quarter move to the cloud or whether or not they move, adding cloud services even if they have on prem because they believe in a hybrid model, is actually the structural guide post we have on a multi-year -- on a multi-year journey.
