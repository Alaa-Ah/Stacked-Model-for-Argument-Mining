HeJxFg2l6k CLAIM-Opinion(view) 478 580 Overall, again, the way I look at it is, first of all I'm most focused on obviously our organic growth
8BHnRPCEsf NON-ARG 582 616 And in there, Amy alluded to this.
pc-4X6JcSx PREMISE-Fact 617 742 We've made significant changes in how we've allocated our own organic dollars, both in R&D as well as in sales and marketing.
nDnDS1jBTY PREMISE-Hypothesis 743 925 And we'll continue to do that because I think there are significant new opportunities for us to go after, and that will require us to reallocate aggressively, and that to me is core.
mPK0v6bciM PREMISE-Fact 926 975 But beyond that, we will look at inorganic means.
8Un-pI2aBt CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1195 1301 So we are not afraid to bring in new capability, but then also questioning what is the allocation we have.
MluBnc5fHf PREMISE-Fact 976 1194 When I look at all the acquisitions that we have made over the course of last year and our OpEx guidance for next year shows how disciplined we are in bringing new talent in, be it in R&D, be it in sales and marketing.
y21NeKvuBh CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1522 1551 So we'll continue to do that.
UxTtH9CWSt PREMISE-Fact 1302 1364 Of course, we have done smaller acquisitions, but they add up.
bKk4nzXv1o PREMISE-Fact 1365 1520 They're pretty significant when you add up all the things that we have done in the Office 365 space, all of the things that we have done in the Azure space
OmUhrV8GgC CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1731 1882 So I won't shy away from it because what's important to us is growth in areas where we have something unique to contribute and long-term profitability.
XyerMV4Rl7 PREMISE-Fact 1552 1730 And if anything comes up in M&A which allows us to pursue our strategic vision that we will need to even allocate more to on an OpEx basis, post-acquisition we will look at that.
