NFfYNqMSjY CLAIM-Opinion(view) 752 916 And the pilots, the place which in the second half is going to be a huge focus for us is the enterprise deployment, and that's where I think there's real excitement
wYkuIDI2W3 PREMISE-Fact 917 1013 because of some of the core capabilities of Windows 10 when it comes to security, manageability.
u01f_q9s7X CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1609 1851 And so overall, we do think that this tablet that can replace your laptop is ideally suited for productivity needs, which means it's great for your personal use as well as your use inside of the enterprise, and we continue to see good growth.

ckOWawQSrG CLAIM-Reformulated 2867 2914 So I think it's the combination of all of that.
7lSnIDMqrm PREMISE-RealExample 2561 2865 If you look at even the thing that we're seeing is in terms of engagement, with the browser or things like Xbox Live with the Store, or new device categories like the 2-in-1, all I think make it much more possible for users to engage with Windows in more mobile formats and in more productivity scenarios
pN7JLqlMmW PREMISE-Fact 2915 2995 But it starts with having a good product truth which Windows 10 does deliver on.
42GQpgSJG8 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 631 751 As far as the upgrade momentum, the fact that we crossed 200 million active devices, we feel very, very good about that.
