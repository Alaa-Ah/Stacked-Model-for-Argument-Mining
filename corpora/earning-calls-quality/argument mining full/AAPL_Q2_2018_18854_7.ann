o4Do1z5A5t NON-ARG 400 409 Hi, Katy.
iybv9ItCpf NON-ARG 410 419 It's Tim.
rCK9xMZmsu PREMISE-Statistic 420 442 The services grew 31%.
AL18mhTCwF PREMISE-Statistic 443 519 We hit an all-time record at $9.2 billion, first time we cleared $9 billion.
7PsaIdGIPf PREMISE-Fact 520 590 The great news about it is, it's not a single geo or a single service.
B2sOG7_qWE PREMISE-Statistic 591 651 If you look at it, each of the geos, the minimum was at 25%.
0K-LEy_zXP CLAIM-Fact 652 780 So each of the geos did extremely well and we set records from the App Store to the Apple Music to iCloud to Apple Pay and more.
YkRtvNZ76w PREMISE-Statistic 781 1027 And underneath that, if you look at the subscriptions, the number of subscriptions, I think I mentioned this in my comments, paid subscriptions had moved up over 100 million on a year-over-year basis to over 270 million by the end of the quarter.
aVSUj4v1cY CLAIM-Reformulated 1028 1107 And so it's very broad-based in terms of type of service and geographic region.
ZigUrXsay- NON-ARG 1108 1155 It's sort of exactly what we would like to see.
kucUnCf9b- NON-ARG 1156 1409 In terms of forecasting moving forward, we've obviously made assumption for our guidance that Luca provided earlier and in terms of longer term, we're on target to our 2020 goal of doubling the services revenue of 2016 as we had talked about previously.
CJ0wktgw8V PREMISE-Other 1796 2007 Yeah, I think my own view is that China and the U.S. have this unavoidable mutuality where China only wins if the U.S. wins and the U.S. only wins if China wins and the world only wins if China and the U.S. win.
zF3P2cuS1B CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2008 2112 And so I think there's lots of things that bind the countries together and I'm actually very optimistic.
nKl-6XXXjk PREMISE-Other 2113 2240 I think history shows us that countries that embrace openness and diversity do much, much better than the ones that are closed.
ARJz27joNZ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2241 2363 And so I'm a big believer that the two countries together can both win and grow the pie, not just allocate it differently.
pLW_xbV_0u CLAIM-Reformulated 2364 2511 And so that's our focus, and I'm optimistic that â€“ I don't know every play by play that will happen, but over time, I think that view will prevail.
