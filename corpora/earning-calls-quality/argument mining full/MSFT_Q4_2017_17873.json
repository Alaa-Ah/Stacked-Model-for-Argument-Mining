Question for Amy, Amy there were a lot of numbers in this print that look very strong, but one that stood out to me was the commercial bookings growth of 30%, you did touch on it a little bit in your remarks, but if you don't mind I\u2019d love to ask you a few questions, one is you mentioned that may be part of the strength was terrific execution on renewals, does it feel like maybe last quarter was a little bit of a renewal flush and in other words it might have been a one-time phenomenon? Secondly, is Microsoft doing anything different around contract, structure, or invoicing to that would result in bookings being unusually high, maybe collecting a little bit more upfront?
