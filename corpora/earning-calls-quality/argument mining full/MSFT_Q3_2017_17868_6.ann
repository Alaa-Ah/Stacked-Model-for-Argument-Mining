_HRZquvBvt NON-ARG 827 857 That's great, so let me start.
u0NGZq_hbQ PREMISE-Fact 858 1039 The best way to think about how people are using, whether it's Azure or Dynamics 365 or other capabilities we have, is in the context of that digital transformation and the outcome.
LaihGV4UkI CLAIM-Fact 1040 1317 So when you say killer apps, the killer apps are how are customers able to reimagine how they think about customer engagement, how they think about employee empowerment or the operational efficiency, or how they can change the products and the business models and the products.
affkRqhFb2 PREMISE-RealExample 1318 1478 And if you look at even the examples I used in this quarterly earnings call, Maersk and what they are trying to do across all of those is pretty transformative.
JKZgGML8EA PREMISE-RealExample 1479 1511 There is machine learning in AI.
GgFMG1KME- PREMISE-RealExample 1512 1525 There is IoT.
ZokXF2GN96 PREMISE-RealExample 1526 1591 There is new type of business process automation with operations.
26HAU6-jU- PREMISE-RealExample 1592 1627 All of that is transforming Maersk.
akXpWOsHeO PREMISE-RealExample 1628 1938 What thyssenkrupp has done in their Elevator business and other business units by using anything from HoloLens to a front-line worker to how they're fundamentally moving their business model from essentially the margin on the thing to the margin on the service, which has machine learning and AI built into it.
7EGiKFIgdw CLAIM-Reformulated 1939 2008 Those are the killer transformation opportunities that we are seeing.
BUl80Szikv PREMISE-Fact 2009 2138 And in fact, it's not about in fact taking any old workload per se, but it's about reimagining what they want to do across these.
v2031CJmZJ PREMISE-Fact 2139 2286 And in that context, of course, they're lifting and shifting some of the older workloads, but they're modernizing the entire business process flow.
wl64lLGjN- CLAIM-Reformulated 2287 2381 And that's what's I think the killer opportunity, not any one technology, but the entire flow.
OyatxNOXyS NON-ARG 2395 2488 And I think your question about is it really budgets, I think you used the phrase opening up.
VV9TbIUFts NON-ARG 2489 2590 What I think is really interesting is, I don't know, I read probably the same CIO surveys you all do.
pNG9cZNvRO CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2591 2705 Frankly, the numbers in those in terms of IT spend or intent to spend, they aren't much different than we've seen.
5FplP_GByp PREMISE-Fact 2706 2850 For me, what I think is missing in that question is really â€“ it's not about any one customer saying wait, I'm going to spend 2% more or 3% more.
sNHqFlz65c PREMISE-Fact 2851 3014 These are companies actually deciding that the change is required, not from an infrastructure perspective, but to change how they're running their business itself.
kF51UPdYPZ PREMISE-Fact 3015 3274 And so things that used to look more to them like capital expense or COGS or not just an IT budget, this is literally changing every business process they run or changing the services they offer, and thinking about literally driving their revenue differently.
hOquUy-6f0 PREMISE-Fact 3275 3386 And so I don't really associate it probably as much with a quote-unquote, budget that sits in IT very narrowly.
2Wwb5w_Opa PREMISE-Fact 3387 3552 This is really about every budget that sits not just in IT, but under every functional leader of a company being spent differently and being spent on our technology.
tyJOFpxZsh NON-ARG 3563 3580  Thank you, Mark.
