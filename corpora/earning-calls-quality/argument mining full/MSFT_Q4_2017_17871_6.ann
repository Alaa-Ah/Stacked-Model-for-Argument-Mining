QXf2WMMztJ NON-ARG 716 767 Let me break down the question in a couple of ways.
DneWHOhMzr CLAIM-Fact 768 870 Overall, when you think about COGS and the pacing, the depreciation rates of our servers don't change.
PVtRHf5T1n PREMISE-Fact 871 996 It’s generally over a three-year period and there is other pieces of equipment that have a longer, shorter depreciation life.
Mym2Yo-gkI PREMISE-Fact 997 1049 So that piece of depreciation doesn't change per se.
2o_uGlB0uD CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1050 1217 If you're looking to see how we see demand, obviously this quarter in Q4, we felt very good about cloud demand across all three services, but in particular with Azure.
V1rIsiHTAK PREMISE-Other 1218 1312 I feel confident in our ability to produce gross margin improvement across all those services.
mV8KvJyB8R PREMISE-Other 1313 1484 I feel confident in our ability to continue to make progress on our overall commercial cloud gross margin growth, and I am encouraged by the demand signals we are getting.
knl3kHWstj PREMISE-Other 1485 1683 All of those things I think, it’s not really about the pace, it is much about the progress and demand and meeting those things as closely as we can and I feel really good about the team's execution.
YBAaUHrLgK NON-ARG 1729 1771  We will move to the next question please.
