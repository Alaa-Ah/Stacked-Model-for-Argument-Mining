It\u2019s really followed technological change, if you think back even four years, you can\u2019t really take a video, a lot of videos buffered on your phone. And now, you think about what people can do. They can consume video very easily on a phone. They can share video, they can take video. And so we\u2019re seeing very \u2013 we\u2019re seeing a lot of interest along a lot of consumer products. It\u2019s also probably worth mentioning that video is within a bunch of our products. So, we certainly have video in feed and people can put video into stories and different places. And we also have the specific Watch place, where we\u2019re looking at original content. I think to the second part of your question, which is how do we think about video content. Most of the content, people put up on Facebook video or other is user-generated, that\u2019s also true of the watch content itself. We have made some investments there in creating a more dedicated place to watch video. So, while a lot of the content is still provided by people in a way that we\u2019re not covering costs, we do have a strategy of investing in great content that really starts the flywheel growing \u2013 going and we\u2019ve been pretty pleased, I mean it\u2019s not the biggest effort anyone has, but we\u2019ve had some hits from Tom and Time to Tom and Time to Red Table Talk ,sorry for your loss, and we\u2019re seeing some really nice engagement numbers on these shows. And the best of them actually carry over into the Facebook community, because the best of the people creating those shows and starring in those shows are also engaging with Facebook, and I think the vision Mark laid out for this all along is that, we should do video in a pretty social way. When you think about video ads, video ads are pretty exciting, because it\u2019s obviously a firm asset marketers have long loved. I think one of the challenges we\u2019ve had is training the market that you can\u2019t just take your TV ads and put them on video \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, put them on mobile or put them into Facebook, because they don\u2019t perform the same way. The best TV ad is 30 seconds, it builds slowly to a story, the product reveal is usually at the very end, the best mobile first ad or ad-on Facebook kind of gets to the main point or gets to the product in the first three seconds, captures your attention much more quickly. We sometimes talk about it as some stopping creative, where you actually want to stop and watch. I think the good news we have here is that mobile first video on Facebook right now is now over 50% of video revenue. So that shows real growth people understanding they need to do it differently, but we\u2019ve still got a pretty long way to go, and we are seeing good results. I\u2019ll share an example, McDonalds. McDonalds used mobile app video ads in Facebook and Instagram News Feed and Stories to launch a limited edition called the Big Mac range in the UK. They had a 16.5% lift in ad recall and then Nielsen\u2019s study showed a nearly 20% incremental reach on Facebook versus TV.
