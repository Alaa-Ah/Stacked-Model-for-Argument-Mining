TqWcPcSDNe NON-ARG 785 789 Yes.
lUdIASYggs NON-ARG 790 855 Doug, why don't I take the decel question on the U.S. and Canada?
MABCcNDaTP CLAIM-Opinion(view) 856 973 I don't think there was anything particularly surprising about the deceleration in the growth in the U.S. and Canada.
mdKf2fUwvG PREMISE-Fact 974 1103 We've been talking about expecting a deceleration in ad revenue growth, and we saw that play out in the U.S. and Canada modestly.
OgozU7JZHY PREMISE-Fact 1104 1271 Obviously, we were particularly pleased that there was really strong demand that benefited regions like APAC and rest-of-world, so really broad-based strength in APAC.
hNu-oiz8l3 PREMISE-Fact 1272 1397 And then rest-of-world, we saw a rebound in Latin America, especially Brazil, so we're seeing some particular strength there.

3jWyHeGFwB PREMISE-Fact 1636 1708 In the long run, we expect to see a revenue share model on the platform.
sLHf6gDj3J PREMISE-Fact 1709 1804 And obviously, we're going to be in an area where we're sharing revenue with content providers,
zL_lTe1ePU CLAIM-Fact 1805 1919 so it's going to have a different margin profile than core Facebook News Feed from an expense profile perspective.
31GaxCsEph NON-ARG 1944 1977 I think you pretty much got that.
8ZfLstuD20 NON-ARG 1995 2000 Okay.
