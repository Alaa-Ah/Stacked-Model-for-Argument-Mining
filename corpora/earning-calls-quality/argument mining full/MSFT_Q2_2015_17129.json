Thank you, guys for taking our question. I just wanted to dig into Windows OEM ASPs a little bit and just trying to sort of better understand the dynamic theme of what we see in the marketplace when we look at industry analysts that we're looking at basically sort of flat to slightly down unit growth and the down 13% OEM revenue growth that you guys are seeing.

I'll take the opportunity actually to do it for both Pro as well as non-Pro because I wasn\u2019t sure which category you were talking about. Let me start at the highest level, which is if I work at industry analyst as well as many of our peers in the ecosystem, I actually think we agree with most of the benchmarks in terms of PC unit health across business, which has been stable since FY '13 and across consumer where we see meaningful progress made in unit growth both last quarter and especially this one. So then I'll take a second and talk about sort of the distinction between the revenue growth versus the unit growth. Let me start first in Pro. There they're really two key dynamics, the first is the return to the XP levels that we saw prior to the XP refresh. They're consistent, the dynamic mix in terms of emerging markets and developed as well as enterprise sizing is not an ASP problem in Pro. It is a return to the attach level we saw before. The component that actually has impacted -- the second component in Pro that is a quote unquote \u201cASP/mix comment\u201d is the academic licenses that I referred to earlier where we did lower the price and saw an increased unit number. So that was a second component of the revenue piece, but the larger component was the XP reversion and again that's not an ASP comment. When you come to non-Pro, I think this really refers back to Satya's comments, which is we saw device growth in low price devices opening price points, we actually made I believe a strategic decision to increase our ability to put devices on the shelf, especially at retail at prices under $200 to $249 is how to think about the price points that were the most impacted. We do have the Windows with things skewed there. It is a lower RPL than our traditional non-Pro OEM licenses, but I do believe it drove meaningful ecosystem health and as well drove good competitive dynamics in the channel. And so overall while it did have an RPL impact, which does explain along with mix shift, the minus 13% in non-Pro OEM versus the PC license growth that we saw, I think really Satya covered the actual logic to that in terms of overall ecosystem health as we feel quite good about.", "start": 799, "labels": ["ANSWER"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 3021, "text": "Keith Weiss", "start": 3009, "labels": ["ANALYST"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 3360, "text": ": And if I could squeeze in one follow-up, have you guys done any assessment in terms of the set you're seeing in Surface Pro 3 definitely is a real productivity device.
