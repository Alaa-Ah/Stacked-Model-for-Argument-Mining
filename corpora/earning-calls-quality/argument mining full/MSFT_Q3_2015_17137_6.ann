yQmzHucBlz NON-ARG 920 971 Let me start, and Amy you could take it from there.
oKucpD45S4 CLAIM-Fact 972 1248 Overall I would say there’s a secular movement that’s happening in particular with Office 365, quite frankly, it’s happening across the entire product portfolio of Microsoft which is more to what I would described as annuity relationship as well as subscription relationships.
VPH0n0r122 PREMISE-Fact 1717 1931 Whereas now with the cloud for the first time we now can serve both individuals as well as small businesses with the same kind of sophistication that in the past was exclusively available for the large enterprises.
US4cYXRkes CLAIM-Reformulated 2097 2242 So that’s what we’re seeing is increasing, what I would call, annuity relationships and subscription relationships with all classes of customers.
DDllMeUrBW PREMISE-Fact 2377 2518 They may have consumed one or two workloads but now they can have the opportunity to consume the entirety of the portfolio and not just that.
SqKYEFCy_v PREMISE-RealExample 2519 2806 If you look at the products in Office 365 that we have, take eDiscovery it’s a complete new space for us where we are able to do things in security eDiscovery enterprise management that we didn’t even do for the top end of the enterprise in the service side, so that’s what we’re seeing.
Em1J8K_A1_ PREMISE-Fact 1249 1393 Because those of a long-term contracts relationships we want to have with our customers be it consumer, be it small business or large customers.
CKavTIKc7o CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1394 1578 In all the years I’ve been at Microsoft it was always our dream to be able to sell more of the sophisticated capabilities of Office to individual consumers as well as small businesses.
MZQ1u0A0n4 PREMISE-Fact 1579 1716 But it was hard to do in the previous generation because of the server infrastructure and what I would say sophistication of IT required.
x7U5ccI61S PREMISE-Fact 2243 2376 And it’s new penetration, so it’s not even a one-for-one replacement, even for the enterprise customer there consumption is going up.
sn818Gs53r PREMISE-Fact 1932 2096 That’s what you see when we see our subscription growth in consumer, we see subscription growth in small business these are folks who never bought a server from us.
nfnVPXWfWU NON-ARG 2817 2882 And, Phil, on the math that sits behind that, it’s a good timing.
KfzGBGsCun NON-ARG 2883 3067 Next week at the financial analyst briefing, I’ll send the – and have a lot more time to explain the actual lifetime value of each of these customer segments, especially in Office 365.
l7ZDU-6NkJ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3397 3437 I do think we’ve made a lot of progress.
e0tVLozt60 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3570 3689 And so I think we’ll be able to show the progress we’ve made over every quarter, and give you some goals going forward.
2sNvVOzJtT NON-ARG 3690 3766 So I look forward to having the chance to spend more time on that in detail.
gpbxJKuOAx PREMISE-RealExample 3767 3807 And SMB looks very similar in some ways.
s5YKPYFa_f PREMISE-RealExample 3808 3947 They purchased similarly, was bought with a PC, was bought one time, it was infrequent, with an inability, as Satya said, to add workloads.
6X-cMC5fpH CLAIM-Reformulated 3948 4064 So I think those are some of the bigger transitions you’ve seen for us in terms of being able to increase the value.
RDp7cJmG1e NON-ARG 4065 4136 So hopefully, we’ll be able to give you more details on that next week.
PVjZuudzGX PREMISE-RealExample 3068 3209 But I think in consumer, it’s maybe the easiest one to talk about, is that we talked about license growth of 10%, when you correct for Japan.
sxkzvlKMoW PREMISE-Fact 3210 3396 Our ability to quickly, I think, move our customer base through stronger execution, both direct through retail and having our channel execute well and partner with us on this transition.
vlTgPQx8gI CLAIM-Fact 3438 3569 And maybe more importantly, we continue to innovate in the product and deliver value to the end user, which is really what matters.
TORtiBHVFf NON-ARG 4254 4268  Thanks, Phil.
