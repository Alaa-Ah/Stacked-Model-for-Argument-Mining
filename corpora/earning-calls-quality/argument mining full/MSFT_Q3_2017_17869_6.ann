6FcjWThqwC CLAIM-Opinion(view) 465 543 Overall, we continue to expect each service is going to get better and better.
icPjT3DiVi PREMISE-Fact 544 697 That happens from two things, premium mix revenue doing well, as well as the efficiencies we expect to get in COGS resulting in gross margin improvement.
DKSzjkhHGQ NON-ARG 698 802 Now to your specific question on can you expect it every quarter sequentially, the answer is not really.
4vmOkLG2Mz PREMISE-Fact 803 869 The mix amongst the services will always result in a pacing change
WzLhUml5Q3 PREMISE-Fact 871 1153 And so while year over year you may not see as much, but you will see more sequential volatility as, frankly, you've seen over the past six quarters, even when we've seen improvements in each of the underlying and underlying services, which tends to be how I focus on it a bit more.

o71TiVPLlK CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1535 1729 In general, for the full fiscal year, we'll be right at or a little below where I thought we would have been, and so that's why the full-year perspective that growth will slow is still on track.
a2R5_X9L2Z PREMISE-Fact 1730 1802 And for simplicity, I generally would think about all the delta from Q3.
jSj5KJlmlT PREMISE-Fact 1803 1883 I would encourage you just to move it into Q4 as you think about what to expect.
