CpBs3l1Wnl NON-ARG 910 949 Sure, Heather, thanks for the question.
ulNHxOE7v2 PREMISE-RealExample 950 1103 Overall qualitatively, in terms of PaaS adoption of Azure, a lot of it comes with what's happening, for example, in the services we talk about, like IoT.
UY1s-c4798 PREMISE-Fact 1104 1152 We now have a much higher-level managed service.
O0oq7iz96f PREMISE-Fact 1153 1387 We even launched a new packaging of it with the IoT Central, which allows developers who are building IoT solutions, instead of assembling it themselves to be able to use this managed service to be that much more agile and productive.
J7qTqgbdxK CLAIM-Fact 1388 1509 So that's usually the way we make the atomic parts available as well as these essentially SaaS services or PaaS services.
MacL9HnwnP PREMISE-Fact 1716 1818 We even see, obviously, the end-user parts of the infrastructure when it comes to enterprise mobility.
JAzHGjyjT_ PREMISE-RealExample 1510 1573 Same thing with data, the DocumentDB is a massive thing for us.
tjE-SN1kVO PREMISE-Fact 1574 1715 It's the planet-scale database that supports JSON and much more, and we see that as a core part of the data tier for many, many applications.
O5cwslhPCK CLAIM-Fact 1819 1854 So all-up, we have multiple pieces.
eo3Q_dE7c4 PREMISE-Fact 1855 2181 The other areas, course, the entire toolchain of what's happening with Visual Studio to continuous integration, to continuous deployment, and that's a place where we have a very, very differentiated solution for developers and developer productivity, which in some sense you can think of as like the Office 365 for developers.
eRZvmB6B8_ PREMISE-Fact 2182 2211 But that's all part of Azure.
gKQta0eiWt CLAIM-Fact 2212 2266 So those are the places where there are PaaS services.
_WT_wlAk6n CLAIM-Fact 2267 2497 But as I said earlier in response to the question, we also welcome the use of, I'll say, the most atomic building blocks of Azure, whether it just be a Linux container, Azure functions, which is very cost-efficient for developers,
dvh6oeediD PREMISE-Other 2498 2615 because we know that over time, it may be not just PaaS services in Azure, it could be in fact a Dynamics 365 module.
yIamWBmq1p CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2616 2800 The canonical example for me is someone who collects data, does a prediction, ultimately then has to do something about that prediction, which means some automation like field service.
zYtNNiqT3t PREMISE-Fact 2801 2964 So a lot of what is Dynamics field service is actually in our module growth we are seeing because of Azure IoT, and that relationship is not just about Azure PaaS.
IjWSI8GEUV NON-ARG 2978 3207 And to your specific question, Heather, on FY 2018 and OpEx, I did not because we're going to see each other and have more time on May 10 at the analyst briefing, and that's where I'll take some more time to walk through FY 2018.
SSUKdtasuU NON-ARG 3246 3266  Thank you, Heather.
QtMSuRXRVV NON-ARG 3267 3305 We'll go to the next question, please.
