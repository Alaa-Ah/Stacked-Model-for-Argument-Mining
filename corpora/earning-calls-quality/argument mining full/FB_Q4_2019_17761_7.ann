TpKjH1h4T2 NON-ARG 397 562 So before we answer that, I'm going to go back and answer the messaging monetization, second half of the last question, if that's okay, and then we'll take this one.
u4e1pjcBwL CLAIM-Fact 564 611 On messaging, we are so really focused on this.
40y-E2X_cR CLAIM-Opinion(view) 612 821 And we think, in many ways, we're better positioned than anyone else in the industry to participate in the opportunity that should be there over the long run for businesses and consumers to connect on message.
zlsUU9aSOV CLAIM-Fact 822 889 In terms of direct ads in messaging, we're taking that very slowly.
3eDM447dZb PREMISE-Fact 890 931 We have a very slow rollout in Messenger.
RivLsjSZVB PREMISE-Fact 932 974 We don't have that rolled out in WhatsApp.
BRY1U0EcXa CLAIM-Opinion(view) 976 1077 Where we are seeing a lot of growth and really exciting metrics right now are click-to-messaging ads.
gk8Hwzeyoh PREMISE-Fact 1078 1212 These are one of the fastest-growing ad formats in our family, especially with SMBs in markets like APAC, but really across the board.
-8zJxaxWaB PREMISE-Fact 1213 1381 And what happens is that from Facebook or Instagram Feed or from Facebook, Instagram or Messenger Stories, you can click-to-message a business on Messenger or WhatsApp.
xMtzbwujQN PREMISE-Fact 1382 1425 It's a really good way to drive engagement.
tAjZPlEAF9 PREMISE-Fact 1426 1584 It also really takes people further down the funnel from seeing an ad to having a direct connection with businesses, which consumers like and businesses like.
adNwOzgDxp CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1585 1625 We also think the ROI is very high here.
rkB65et5zy NON-ARG 1627 1652 So I'll share an example.
w6bRuKCyyV PREMISE-RealExample 1653 1699 Manulife from Vietnam is an insurance company.
57dXUFT0XB PREMISE-RealExample 1700 1758 They use click-to-messaging ads to generate qualify leads.
gO8H1cHlEg PREMISE-RealExample 1759 1897 And compared to Facebook lead ads, which were already performing well, those ads had 2.4x more qualified leads and a 4x increase in sales.
HW-uVHg4C_ CLAIM-Reformulated 1898 2085 And so we think the combination of the discovery ads that we can do, clicking through the Messenger right now already shows the potential of how important messaging can be for businesses.
vZL1q8t0Qj NON-ARG 2103 2107 Yes.
oT62lyX5GE NON-ARG 2108 2166 And I could talk a little bit about the Dating experience.
Dy82IqMMJk CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2167 2183 It's going well.
zf6l7gBvAj CLAIM-Reformulated 2184 2263 I don't think we have any specific stats to share on this, but it's going well.
IBgFK1AW1- CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2264 2362 And we -- I think we're already one of the top dating services, and we expect to continue growing.
myRJ9JKc6D NON-ARG 2364 2462 In terms of where we launched it, we launched a number of countries before bringing it to the U.S.
m9nmFWKblR NON-ARG 2463 2554 And our product development approach is that we launch something, and then we get feedback.
z0RF6gHAQ2 NON-ARG 2555 2599 We try to test things before we launch them.
wsRCabIPdO NON-ARG 2600 2674 But then there are some things that you can't learn until you have it out.
RUELTVvkHl NON-ARG 2675 2810 And then we will kind of keep on iterating on it until -- in a number of countries, people who use it really like it and keep using it.
-Xf9h9DSIN NON-ARG 2811 2855 And then we rolled it out to more countries.
-V4j5zWRlv NON-ARG 2856 2890 So we did that over the last year.
V9Wk-ND8uW CLAIM-Fact 2891 3023 We'll continue doing that in more places, but the U.S. was certainly one of the biggest places that we were focused on launching it.
I4USRyy2QL CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3025 3276 Overall, I mean the way that Dating fits into the strategy here is within the Facebook app, we think that News Feed is really central and that it's one of the only things that we think everyone who uses the app is really going to use on a daily basis.
zvg7rWqeoc CLAIM-Reformulated 3941 4177 So I kind of expect in a year or 2, the world that we're going to be in is people use Facebook, they're going to use News Feed, and then they're probably each going to have 2 or 3 other of these social utilities that they find valuable.
Vq7bKufWwr NON-ARG 4178 4437 And as we start building those, I think that that's some part of the story that you're seeing on why the Facebook app engagement has been strong recently is -- especially as we build more of these things that certainly is showing up in how people use the app.
oIDres54QL CLAIM-Fact 3763 3939 But even if tens or hundreds of millions of people use them, then we're adding unique value that other folks might not be able to build, and we're making the app more valuable.
4tvUD62Toz CLAIM-Fact 3277 3414 But there are different social utilities that even if not everyone wants to use them, hundreds of millions of people might find value in.
R4QeO4WmZH PREMISE-RealExample 3415 3475 So whether that's Marketplace for buying and selling things.
yEjSwZAaPo PREMISE-RealExample 3476 3591 Groups and communities, we think, is increasingly ubiquitous, but the tab there isn't going to be used by everyone.
q9lgnlMk_K PREMISE-RealExample 3649 3762 Things like Watch or the News tab that we have started rolling out are not things that we expect everyone to use.
zoy8NMMHCI CLAIM-Reformulated 3592 3648 It's going to be used by hundreds of millions of people.
