NyjeFD-KM8 PREMISE-RealExample 1054 1384 For example, in FinServ, some very Tier 1 trading applications now using some of our capabilities in service fabric, which is really a PaaS service, which allows you to manage microservices with low latency and high scale, that's a place where we are seeing in fact activity, whether it's game development or trading applications.
674iYlxFEb PREMISE-Fact 1385 1477 We are seeing even interesting use cases of Azure functions, which is completely serverless.
mYhvgz5XfZ PREMISE-Fact 1478 1596 In fact, you can think of it as a price cut for anybody who cares about being very, very smart about cloud consumption
ro24TxWnsc PREMISE-Fact 1598 1653 Going serverless is something that we in fact advocate.
x-cESa6wi8 PREMISE-Fact 1654 1862 So across the board, I feel we have the right mix of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, and per user SaaS services like Azure Active Directory, which gives us the right mix to be able to even have the right margins long term.
