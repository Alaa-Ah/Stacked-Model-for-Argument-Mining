k_vY6d4opV NON-ARG 516 554 I will start with the second question.
8TbZjTEOZv CLAIM-Fact 555 694 So I would just say Prime Day had enormous impact on the device business and devices were well featured and also well adopted by customers.
Rd8H7t-3Iq PREMISE-Fact 695 851 So it was the largest device sales day that we've ever had and essentially pretty much across all of our device types, E-readers, tablets, Fire TV and Echo.
YirsY6HGN6 NON-ARG 852 866 And I'm sorry.
6RSBiIXYU1 NON-ARG 867 932 Your first question was around – the cost of fulfillment centers.
G1uqo7z9RW NON-ARG 1331 1380 Maybe the volume is not perfect for robot volume.
8ftcIEtLPH NON-ARG 1381 1390 But yeah.
Tv0jsVZdN8 NON-ARG 1391 1452 But, yes, so I can't give you any real distinct trends there.
_LcjSgspeT NON-ARG 1113 1330 So no general trends I can point to on cost per fulfillment center to start up because they do vary in size and mission and some have fully outfitted in using Amazon Robotics, others – some don't for economic reasons.
rsgKHpUeVo NON-ARG 933 1002 Not disclosing that we do continue to change our fulfillment centers.
IpQulqsjlH NON-ARG 1003 1112 We've changed, again, the automation, the size, the scale many times and we continue to learn and grow there.
