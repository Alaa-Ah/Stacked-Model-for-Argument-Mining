-AeqofLsqR CLAIM-Opinion(view) 519 587 we remain extremely bullish on China and we're continuing to invest.
2PZBAicKgc CLAIM-Opinion(view) 588 715 Nothing that's happened has changed our fundamental view that China will be Apple's largest market at some point in the future.
ArFKXnjj5p PREMISE-Fact 716 797 It's true, as you point out, that the equity markets have recently been volatile.
Oy8AM9Q-1H PREMISE-Other 798 850 This could create some speed bumps in the near term.
ymS-XyvacD PREMISE-Statistic 851 1096 But to put it in context, which I think is important, despite that volatility in the Chinese market, they're still up 90% over the last year, and they're up 20% year-to-date, and so these kind of numbers are numbers I think all of us would love.
H7rGdLCykV PREMISE-Fact 1097 1175 Also, the stock market participation among Chinese household is fairly narrow.
Kwksf0qndS PREMISE-Fact 1176 1326 And the stock ownership is very concentrated in a few people who put what appears to be a smaller portion of their wealth in the market than we might.
P2I0veRtYK CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1327 1471 And so I think generally this has been, at least as we see it, maybe it's not true for other businesses, that this worry is probably overstated.
hNAyCsFQHG CLAIM-Policy 1472 1507 And so we're not changing anything.
LnlDTgvKgF CLAIM-Policy 1508 1577 We have the pedal to the metal on getting to 40 stores mid next year.
08f4k6stc9 CLAIM-Policy 1578 1665 As we had talked about before, we're continuing to expand the indirect channel as well.
Kso9i6cMeP CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1966 2033 I think that really plays to an incredible smartphone future there.
7OfITMK7jq PREMISE-Statistic 2172 2339 McKinsey, I saw a recent study from McKinsey that's projecting the upper middle class to grow from 14% to 54% of households over the ten-year period from 2012 to 2022.
TPmNPAeQ5P CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2485 2540 And so I think we would be foolish to change our plans.
LrnluGLcw4 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2541 2640 I think China is a fantastic geography with an incredible unprecedented level of opportunity there.
wJtfO2uswT CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2641 2669 And we're going to be there.
dP0a28vyJr PREMISE-Fact 2340 2484 So we're within that period at this moment, and you can see for all of us that travel there so much, with every trip you can see this occurring.
htL5PyFXUP PREMISE-Statistic 1666 1785 As you point out, and I think this is a major point that many people miss, the LTE penetration in China is only at 12%.
hyssZBJcHF PREMISE-Fact 1786 1965 And China doesn't possess the level of fiber that some other countries do, and so in order to get the great video performance, et cetera, raising that penetration is really great.
MW-iFNCRDR CLAIM-Fact 2092 2171 The rise of the middle class there is continuing, and it is transforming China.
QjZnKDNtHW NON-ARG 2034 2091 Also, and I can't underestimate â€“ I can't overstate this.
wYxnebrlWU NON-ARG 3067 3104 Yeah, I'm very familiar with the ads.
jbmumMUxTA NON-ARG 3105 3169 In certain geographies, the way that we win is to get switchers.
VKjXVLYNIQ NON-ARG 3170 3259 In other geographies, the way that we win is to get people to buy their first smartphone.
GLbElBoHSD NON-ARG 3260 3356 In other geographies, the way that we win is to get people to upgrade from their current iPhone.
dVZysuqGOy NON-ARG 3357 3400 And all of those are very important for us.
XWPWIiNKKG NON-ARG 3401 3487 In many geographies, it's two of those or in some geographies it's all three of those.
gYqtCHhxAz NON-ARG 3488 3522 And so all of those are important.
6Wr0upkZI6 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3523 3673 We are very focused on growing iPhone around the world, not just in one geography and getting our message out there through ads is one way to do that.
CeZlDcIqQX NON-ARG 481 519  Yeah, it's a very good question, and
