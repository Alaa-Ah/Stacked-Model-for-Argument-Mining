ut68J2_72f CLAIM-Opinion(view) 566 826 I think the overall adoption cycle of Windows 10 in the enterprise is perhaps the best that we have seen in the enterprise for any new release of Windows, and primarily driven by security and manageability of the new Windows, and that's what's been the driver.
71QGWoyMNL PREMISE-Fact 1205 1390 We're increasingly seeing that resonate, not just in small business and some of the high-tech industry as it has been in the past, but now even in the regulated parts of the enterprise.
Uh7foelEDj CLAIM-Reformulated 1391 1425 So we are very excited about that.
HJBlCmZoj6 CLAIM-Fact 1426 1509 The other piece also that's driving is hardware innovation by the entire ecosystem.
B1FaZtJQW4 PREMISE-RealExample 1510 1674 In fact, the work that we did with the Surface line has really stimulated the entire ecosystem to do some of the best innovative work, and you saw that even at CES.
lPLbvvjf_B CLAIM-Reformulated 1675 1807 And the enterprise adoption of these new devices is also driving the overall excitement around Windows 10 and Windows 10 innovation.
wgnT7w_QUi CLAIM-Fact 827 1204 But in addition to that, I must say there are two other things that are increasingly becoming fairly relevant in the adoption cycle, which is moving to both Office 365 and Windows 10 and getting essentially to this new frontier for productivity, which is an always up-to-date operating system, which is secure, and an always up-to-date Office experience that is a SaaS service.
