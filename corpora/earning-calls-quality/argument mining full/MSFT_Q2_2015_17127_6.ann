CIJtw8Ffag NON-ARG 366 402 Sure Brent, thanks for the question.
l-wx220AJT CLAIM-Opinion(view) 403 589 I think it's the exact product portfolio that we talked about last year when the impact was happening, so let me take this opportunity to sort of walk you through those components again.
NjJ0nXuakT PREMISE-Fact 590 729 Obviously there's a very direct impact, which we've talked the most about in terms of Windows Pro and its mix would attach to business PCs.
P1ObHkI61z PREMISE-Fact 730 1015 The other important component of that was when people bought a PC as we talked through the year, they often took the chance whether generally in the business segment which impacts in our world commercial licensing as a reporting unit to buy Office and generally on a non-annuity basis.
tK98y751RT PREMISE-Fact 1016 1280 So if you think about that being the next major transactional type purchase that was driven a year ago as the first externality, the second was in Windows [DL] [ph] we also saw non-annuity purchases in Windows DL which again is in our commercial licensing segment.
qekT-jlOsf PREMISE-Fact 1281 1364 So if you think about it from a product portfolio, it really is Windows and Office.
vuTBfT0osX PREMISE-Fact 1365 1555 If you think about it from our reporting segments it's the D&C licensing segment as well as our commercial licensing segment and specifically our transactional revenue growth year-over-year.
7nPqCBTHWC NON-ARG 1778 1798 Brent, thanks again.
CtPOfwLoTt NON-ARG 1799 1843 I actually think of it as a general concept.
PdLt8wPuPm CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1844 1921 I think really we're trying to invest behind opportunities where we see them.
nVzMvfiRAo PREMISE-Fact 1922 2069 Some of those are more public as we talk about in terms of our sales and marketing adjustments or Ad campaigns that we run by the commercial cloud.
4gVXfOsSIn PREMISE-RealExample 2070 2351 Others I think you don't have the opportunity to see until we launch products like we did last week where we were able to reassert our product portfolio and really move our talent to invest in, I guess mind blowing is the word Satya used, in terms of product portfolio in that way.
ZKEl7iofZu NON-ARG 2352 2430 So I'm not sure that all of it Brent I would say is across a line in that way.
FQPi22EzH9 NON-ARG 2431 2548 They're short-term optimizations and longer-term portfolio optimizations that I think we've talked about this before.
PtVM7jdTP9 CLAIM-Reformulated 2549 2889 I think the entire Senior Leadership Team views it as an opportunity to think about where we can best innovate and drive the highest value of every dollar that we invest and I think we've made great progress as a team and I think you're seeing that both in the long-term guidance and in frankly our day-to-day execution through the quarter.
xrLVQ1UD_2 PREMISE-Fact 2929 3120 And I will just add that we're also making pretty significant changes in just the very workflow of our engineering teams and that also leads to us getting more out of our current investments.
iHu4C-MrAN CLAIM-Fact 3121 3265 So there is significant I would say combination of culture change as well as how we work change that drives more innovation for the same dollar.
jxDqjYRWIe NON-ARG 3300 3318  Thank you, Brent.
OJwFYpllvM NON-ARG 3319 3360 We will move to the next question please.
