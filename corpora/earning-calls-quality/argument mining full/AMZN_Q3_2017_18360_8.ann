0TxmwGAMcj NON-ARG 660 664 Yes.
ExC6Y7Karn NON-ARG 665 680 Thanks, Justin.
DIW56Su9uA NON-ARG 681 694 This is Dave.
w4a8XyZ0zo NON-ARG 743 830 There's some disclosure to (03:57) unearned revenue as part of the cash flow statement.
uF28LtnpHQ PREMISE-Statistic 831 1065 So when you look at that for the three months ended, around 34%, 35% for (04:05) and, historically, what we've seen with unearned revenue is a big and leading contributor (04:12) signing up, paying $99 upfront and having that (04:18).
-Xdh4R3TPu CLAIM-Fact 1066 1142 That continues to be the biggest absolute contributor to what you see there.
tWZf5Xxw-o PREMISE-Fact 1143 1346 The other area that's been growing over the past few years is Amazon Web Services (04:30) instances where those customers can pay for services upfront in some cases and discounts over multi-year periods.
tlYDYn5e6c NON-ARG 1347 1411 What we're seeing more recently, I think, is on the Prime piece.
4QXgPCm41C PREMISE-Fact 1412 1576 We launched month-to-month Prime last year and if you think about how that works, customers are paying $10.99 per month as they go, so there's less that's deferred.
48YNissTVz CLAIM-Fact 1577 1624 So that's, I think, one of a number of factors.
kQ4suz7j2p NON-ARG 1625 1822 So, there's obviously other mix factors going in there besides the pieces that I just mentioned, but we have seen that monthly Prime has been a good driver of getting more members into the program.
ah-jAYmDpn CLAIM-Reformulated 1823 1861 So, that's part of what you're seeing.
LBCaBuYnrx NON-ARG 694 743  I'd also point you to beyond the balance sheet. 
SXKLhGdWyR NON-ARG 1880 2013  And your question about Whole Foods, we're really excited to have them as part of the team now after the acquisition in late August.
PsBkClrtLQ NON-ARG 2014 2196 What you see in the financial results for this quarter is, it's shown actually in the new physical stores revenue component, $1.3 billion of revenue, $21 million of operating income.
YSBFPvoDiw NON-ARG 2197 2266 And that's where you'll be seeing the Whole Foods revenue showing up.
CMtCOaVtIM NON-ARG 2267 2442 In addition, that is, the cost of revenue, physical stores revenue is going to be where we're going to book any sales where the customer physically selects an item in a store.
nadLhuhhKt NON-ARG 2443 2502 So, it will also include, or does include our Amazon Books.
gKdrVOxyvW NON-ARG 2503 2861 But if you step back on Whole Foods, again, I think we've had busy months since we've joined forces, offering lower prices on a range of key grocery items in the stores, launching the Whole Foods private label products on Amazon, the technical (06:07) work to make Prime the Whole Foods customer rewards program, and we'll have that coming out in the future.
EiisVzRpyT NON-ARG 2862 2918 We've added Amazon Lockers to select Whole Foods stores.
UfXHmhxthy NON-ARG 2919 3039 So lots of activity, lots of energy and we're really excited to show customers what's possible when we join forces here.
