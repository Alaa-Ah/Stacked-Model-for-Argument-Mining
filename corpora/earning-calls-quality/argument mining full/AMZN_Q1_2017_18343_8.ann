EsOqik8T_j NON-ARG 493 498 Sure.
-HINnf8Nhs PREMISE-Statistic 499 590 Yes, the CapEx, which is principally the fulfillment centers was – grew 51% year-over-year.
mjO8OUv_HM PREMISE-Fact 591 706 As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last – fulfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year.
BRErRRg78W NON-ARG 1513 1572 As I just mentioned, a lot of that is tied to usage growth.
tWejRvNuqv PREMISE-Statistic 1573 1747 But a caution; CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year.
AOwSQQxaCr NON-ARG 1748 1816 So certainly it was a bigger step-up in 2016 now carrying into 2017.
0Smnw3kHY- CLAIM-Fact 796 834 So there was some carryover from that.
9YWKBWFXDn PREMISE-Fact 707 795 Some of that cost of start-up is before the start-up some comes in a quarter afterwards.
OsdR3VIeW4 NON-ARG 835 964 But generally, the biggest trend here is that the differential between Amazon fulfilled network unit growth and paid unit growth.
UraMYQXSDG NON-ARG 1177 1425 And the fulfillment centers I'll also say with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses, and then they generally have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following their start-up.
dfqeeXkVdF NON-ARG 1426 1463 On the capital leases, that grew 45%.
33UpgPo8Je CLAIM-Fact 1464 1512 A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business.
qqwGrXpBss PREMISE-Statistic 965 1176 So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity.
