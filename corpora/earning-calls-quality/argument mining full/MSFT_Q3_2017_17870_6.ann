0Rp8PMUDak NON-ARG 968 986 Yeah, I can start.
PZPOKEFx3d CLAIM-Opinion(view) 987 1084 I think with Office 365, we are trying to expand the appeal of Office 365 on multiple dimensions.
eUm5OkDBJ7 PREMISE-Fact 1085 1262 A lot of what we are still seeing in play is the rapid adoption or the increased adoption of Office 365 E3, which is what I think is driving a lot of the growth, the ASP growth.
SOminPlFpk PREMISE-Fact 1263 1381 Now we have a good start with what is at the high end of the enterprise value, which is E5, some of the value we have.
z_xlNgJggu PREMISE-Fact 1382 1441 Whether it's voice or analytics and security, it resonates.
cYYfC_fyZH PREMISE-Fact 1442 1519 And we're learning, we're improving, and we're pushing forward on that front.
gInnAty-_E PREMISE-Fact 1520 1596 At the same time, we're also introducing new SKUs for the front-line worker.
KObV6dqH61 PREMISE-Fact 1597 1764 This is one of the other first-time trends I'm seeing where CEOs are more interested in productivity of their front-line workers, and so that's another exciting space.
BzEtIL8RAe PREMISE-Fact 1765 1924 It comes at a different ASP point, so it's not exactly the same as E5, but very important for us strategically to be able to increase the appeal of Office 365.
vi_MIslkij PREMISE-Fact 1925 2021 We also are working to make Office 365 and seeing good traction in segments like small business.
jr0x8rsta8 PREMISE-Fact 2022 2218 The other aspect of Office 365 which is important for us is the international element because we really never had very high penetration of our higher-end service SKUs in the international markets.
zATZosCY6X PREMISE-Fact 2219 2275 And we finally get to do that with the service offering.
3_Lz6TVP7p PREMISE-Fact 2276 2303 So those are all the areas.
mbN-kzoe7H CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2304 2444 Where there's significant room left â€“ and we're not just standing still in terms of adding value for new segments, so those are all in play.
e7GZB8AkcI PREMISE-Fact 2458 2630 And the way you've seen that, and I'll relate it to margins, is this continued and consistent installed base growth, and even still having the opportunities Satya laid out.
VxWAjpB6mn PREMISE-Fact 2631 2759 And most of the ARPU improvement that we've seen has been, in fact still due to the E3 transition, not due to the E5 transition.
WFBSDN2yON CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2760 2877 So we still feel quite good about the opportunity, especially in some of the customers that have already moved to E3.
EkcNekXEAC CLAIM-Fact 2878 2962 And then in terms of gross margin, margin actually here has been steadily improving.
ku_RWuK26m PREMISE-Fact 2963 3025 We've been in this business a bit longer and it's more mature.
auGjDOvjCv PREMISE-Fact 3026 3226 I do think here the opportunity is also ARPU-based actually here in terms of continuing to see margin improvement is continuing raise the dollars per user that we realize to continue to see that grow.
