gzHH7LA0tR NON-ARG 565 622 John, I can real quickly take the pricing question first.
WB8q3kppxi PREMISE-Fact 974 1107 Feed from a growth perspective on an impression front is more constrained given where we are with ad loads on Facebook and Instagram.
aaUt6j5hma CLAIM-Fact 1108 1150 So there'll be more pricing pressure there
DVSCpuJaOB PREMISE-Fact 1151 1207 because there's already strong demand for feed products.
y0Bf75Ot0k NON-ARG 1208 1284 So in terms of convergence, it's hard to say how those things will play out.
k3BNynOsbh CLAIM-Reformulated 1285 1412 We do think there's opportunities to improve the value of the Stories format that will translate into better price for Stories.
nDyI8ykUrF NON-ARG 1413 1487 But how it converges over time, there's a lot of different dynamics there.
MjCiDoca0s PREMISE-Fact 623 716 The reality is pricing is a function of supply and demand and how demand grows versus supply.
gbcEYtb3qt CLAIM-Opinion(view) 717 926 So while I do expect that we'll bring more advertisers to Stories and we'll bring more advertising formats to Stories and that will create more demand for Stories, we're also growing Stories inventory quickly.
cLgknk_S80 NON-ARG 927 973 So those two things will balance out in price.
GgxIFehXPL NON-ARG 1505 1509 Yes.
-ia3KMuoX5 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1510 1677 And on all the content and safety and security issues, there's more to do here but I'm proud of the work that we've done to get in front of a lot more of these issues.
KEwkT24Pw9 PREMISE-Fact 1678 1848 If you think about the journey that the company has really been on for the last couple of years, it's moving from reactively dealing with issues that our community flags.
XMAMiJFX6V PREMISE-Fact 1849 2137 Perhaps if someone sees some content that's problematic, they used to tell us about it and then we'd go look at it to now, increasingly, we're building AI systems and we have tens of thousands of people who are doing more proactive review of content that could be potentially problematic.
0FXwaWpTii PREMISE-Fact 2138 2233 And we're prioritizing the different types of content that we think could create the most harm.
BuR-xB3lYs PREMISE-Fact 2234 2316 So one of the things that we worked on earliest was removing terrorist propaganda.
J-XHRdXk4t PREMISE-Statistic 2317 2484 One of the things that we're proud of there is, there are now 99% of the ISIS and Al Qaeda content that we take down, our AI flags it, removes it before people see it.
rgYYNlVHVc NON-ARG 2485 2568 Another area that we really care about that's deeply important is self-harm, right?
zLwtgKrzLJ NON-ARG 4738 4973 It's also the first priority again for this year, is making - continuing to make progress on the big, substantive issues facing the Internet and our company because there's still a lot more to do here, and this is incredibly important.
nEjdqBKYwp NON-ARG 4974 5078 But I do feel like we've started to turn a corner and have a clear plan for what we need to do here now.
8k-XkPSY38 NON-ARG 5079 5107 So thanks for that question.
5_qKvEL8m3 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2913 3101 And I think in the last six months or a year alone, there have been hundreds, if not thousands, of cases where we're we've been able to get first responders to people when they needed help
D1AP-f7zid PREMISE-Fact 3102 3177 because of this approach of being more proactive on looking at the content.
RTrv6Bz8b5 PREMISE-Fact 2569 2912 And that's an area where the goal isn't to take down the content, but if we see an area where - if we see something that a person might be thinking about hurting themselves, we now have thousands of people and technical tools that can flag this content to those people to - so we can actually go get first responders to go reach out to people.
DOUpFpMU2N CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3601 3845 Right now, we're doing it, I think it's every six months, but the goal is to get that to the cadence by, I think it's the end of this year, we're going to be doing it quarterly and doing calls to discuss the results just like we do for earnings
O4McBI7To0 PREMISE-Fact 3846 3932 because we think that this stuff is really important as well, at the same level there.
6VdIz4zChg CLAIM-Reformulated 3933 4147 So where I come to summarize where I think we are, coming into 2019 is, 2017 and 2018 were really - we had a lot of hard work to do, but we also needed to figure out what the road map was going to be going forward.
m97_IxS4EY CLAIM-Reformulated 4148 4290 And while we haven't solved all of the issues yet - you never solve all of the issues, but we certainly have a lot more to do on our road map.
8Yc75XNPXF NON-ARG 4291 4383 The way that I feel starting 2019 is that we have clear road maps for what we need to go do.
OPpyQdtpDH NON-ARG 4672 4737 And that's just some of the most important work that we're doing.
V3fyWV9vlU CLAIM-Reformulated 4384 4671 And I think you're going to be able to look at these transparency reports as we issue them and see that we're continually making more progress, finding more of the content proactively, taking - getting better at taking it down, getting better at not distributing stuff that's borderline.
l7jZXET3D9 NON-ARG 3564 3600 It's our content enforcement report.
XUxzc5DvvS PREMISE-Fact 3178 3286 The same goes for things around election interference and more proactively looking for inauthentic behavior.
QOwdna-2VL CLAIM-Fact 3287 3394 And we've taken down a lot of effort by different nation states to harm or interfere in elections that way.
TrDtIlrnrD PREMISE-Fact 3395 3470 So we're just going to go down the list of every basic type of bad content.
Rv3HVfRvc1 PREMISE-Fact 3471 3531 And we do report this publicly, going back to your question.
bOD2MvMS-R PREMISE-Fact 3532 3563 We issue a transparency report.
jHIXeLwbHJ NON-ARG 5125 5132  Great.
kGZwrfuYat NON-ARG 5133 5143 Thank you.
WGNVpSvrgs NON-ARG 5144 5175 Thank you for joining us today.
