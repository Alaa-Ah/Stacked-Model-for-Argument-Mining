R1h60425FQ NON-ARG 756 769 Sure, Heather
lzfYsN0c4s CLAIM-Fact 771 1030 On the first one, on the mix between IaaS and PaaS and SaaS, the thing that we are seeing is, quite frankly, all of these are growing but the most interesting thing for me as a pattern is growth in IaaS leads to growth in other PaaS services or SaaS services.
giXC86xIRU CLAIM-Reformulated 1031 1108 I mean to put it very concretely, take something like Azure Active Directory.
BWigiLTE-E CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1109 1231 That's probably the best manifestation of the virtuous cycle that we see in any of the cloud adoption that we have, right.
KQx2aeyVl6 PREMISE-Other 1232 1278 It could be as someone coming from Office 365.
U2gB-c6PYa PREMISE-Other 1279 1330 It can be someone coming from Azure, Dynamics, EMS.
PYo157kuTY PREMISE-Fact 1331 1498 All of those tenants get into Azure Active Directory which is our largest PaaS service because it's got even developer API, so that means more developers are using it.
8eK0Flk2LF PREMISE-Fact 1499 1555 More IT professionals are using it as the control plane.
Q2o2pumGf3 PREMISE-Fact 1556 1632 So that's the network effect that we see when it comes to the PaaS services.
nOOpJeSQpO PREMISE-Fact 1633 1910 And then in terms of infrastructure itself, as again I said, there's people who are tiering, even applications people who build hybrid applications where the storage could be even on premise in some cases, but the mid-tier and the web and the mobile back ends are in the cloud.
C5IKO3dq0G CLAIM-Fact 1911 1940 We see a lot of growth there.
JanSL7cg1s PREMISE-RealExample 1941 2085 We see a lot of growth in our data, both in terms of infrastructure but in the new services like our Data Lake services which are PaaS services.
f_lc5ir4I8 PREMISE-RealExample 2086 2117 Hadoop is another good example.
GYris9ti_7 PREMISE-RealExample 2118 2194 We see lots of Hadoop usage inside of IaaS but we also see HD inside growth.
CETjauoM_D PREMISE-RealExample 2195 2248 So I would say there is a real good mix of those two.
QGHvHD4JqU PREMISE-RealExample 2249 2346 And then on Windows 10, I mean I'm very, very excited obviously about what's happening with Bing.
4x1vEjoMuE PREMISE-Statistic 2347 2469 I think Amy talked about we have a $1 billion quarter with 29% growth and good share position growth in the United States.
PSzeyopuYy CLAIM-Reformulated 2470 2494 That's fantastic to see.
bds0nOXV22 PREMISE-RealExample 2495 2592 But gaming is the other place where we talked about Xbox Live now that spans both console and PC.
wCroFTzleD PREMISE-RealExample 2593 2637 We see increased engagement because of that.
2Ro7FgBoQS PREMISE-RealExample 2638 2701 We see in fact increased engagement with titles like Minecraft.
NotXNP0zKO PREMISE-RealExample 2702 2813 So we have some high hopes for what we can achieve with engagement around Xbox Live across the console plus PC.
