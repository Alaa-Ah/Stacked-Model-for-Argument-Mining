iBhcqZ03Dx NON-ARG 759 788 Stephen, are you're still on?
636UScTZHO NON-ARG 789 864 Can you elaborate more on the countries you're talking about, specifically?
WVIKs3V_8s NON-ARG 1307 1327 Oh, on global store?
sv5bQRfmmX NON-ARG 1328 1333 Okay.
VjN1FNAXI6 NON-ARG 1334 1338 Yes.
ApBArW7AYy NON-ARG 1412 1417 Yeah.
OImlXAVSxi NON-ARG 1418 1477 Sorry, I thought you meant some of our expansion countries.
QoypQi7Ux5 CLAIM-Fact 1704 1815 So it's a great benefit for sellers, and it only works if it's a great benefit for customers on the other side.
EvzasSaY10 PREMISE-Fact 1478 1703 So, yeah, I don't have a lot to share on that today, but I think you hit on the main point, is selection and opportunities for sellers in â€“ who are with us in different countries to reach buyers outside of their home country.
VFmXMwqhQd NON-ARG 864 1125  Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC No, I'm just wondering, you already have a direct presence in some of the countries like China, Japan, et cetera, and the international shopping rollout presumably expands all that selection to most of the globe.
YjiRMgIMzA NON-ARG 1126 1287 So just wondering if you are seeing incremental demand, and where you might be seeing demand coming in from countries where you might not have a direct presence?
ShZiPiJKbu NON-ARG 1338 1392  Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Yeah.
