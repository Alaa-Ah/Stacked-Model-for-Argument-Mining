S5VP93truu PREMISE-Statistic 501 675 As you know, we gave our run rate at the end of last quarter at $4.4 billion and the course we’ve said in our numbers have us on that continued trajectory as we hedge for Q1.
qMoD7IF1ih CLAIM-Opinion(view) 676 763 So, I think the pace and our accomplishment to share gains remain on a good trend line.
e1rRrLpyEk CLAIM-Fact 779 852 And as far as the used cases, right now it’s actually pretty diversified.
1Z-3orwcEL NON-ARG 853 943 We talked pretty extensively about the customer case studies at our cloud event last week.
k07daFSKAA PREMISE-Fact 944 1034 And it turns out that we have ISVs in many cases driving new applications on top of Azure.

PtZ92-1QZM PREMISE-Fact 1687 1747 One of the other categories that I see lot of lately is IOT.
FdCcj1f0_L PREMISE-Fact 1748 2065 And the way we participate just on the Azure side, we obviously participate even with our Windows Embedded, but on the cloud side, we are seeing the attach to our emerging machine learning services as well as advanced analytics that’s been one of the place where we are well suited for some of the emerging use cases.
