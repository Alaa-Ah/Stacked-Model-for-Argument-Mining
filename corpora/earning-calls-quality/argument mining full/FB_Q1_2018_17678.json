Thanks for taking the question. When you think about the opportunities for the business broadly, you obviously are crushing it from an advertising standpoint when you look at any measure of growth.

Like, is there other lines of business, other revenue streams that people should be thinking about that create substantial opportunities, and specifically subscription, and then maybe if you could just touch on from a commerce standpoint now that Instagram's starting to be such a big driver of commerce, how do you think about diversifying revenues versus essentially being almost pure advertising?
