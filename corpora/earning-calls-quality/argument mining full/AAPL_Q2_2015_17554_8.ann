TADxKC2O7G NON-ARG 540 607 Let me talk about supply and demand and sort of separate those two.
n0lUfqht2R PREMISE-Fact 608 649 Right now, demand is greater than supply.
AyW6fGYw0h PREMISE-Fact 650 691 And so we’re working hard to remedy that.
IdhGyiORCu PREMISE-Fact 692 847 We’ve made progress over the last week or so, and we were able to deliver more customers an Apple Watch over the weekend than we had initially anticipated.
U0i4ZovNOg PREMISE-Fact 848 1004 We’re going to keep doing that, and so we’ve already sent some notes out today, moving the customers and versus what we had communicated to them previously.
GT6jc5LEGC CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1005 1063 So I’m generally happy that we’re moving on with the ramp.
qBm7xoFfe1 CLAIM-Fact 1064 1169 It is a new product for us, and with any kind of new product, you wind up taking some time to fully ramp.
ZLC1mLNW0w CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1170 1363 Having said that, I think we’re in a good position and by sometime in late June, we currently anticipate being in a position that we could begin to sell the Apple Watch in additional countries.
qox4umn_kB CLAIM-Policy 1364 1395 And so that’s our current plan.
8uVJxgqj2G NON-ARG 1396 1495 From a demand point of view, it’s hard to gauge when you don’t have product in stores and so forth.
0EcUi5iOvs PREMISE-Fact 1496 1552 So we’re filling orders completely online at the moment.
aILCWizUu4 PREMISE-Fact 1553 1744 The customer response from people that have gotten theirs over the weekend have been overwhelmingly positive, and we’re far ahead of where we expected to be from an application point of view.
oB_m5fKdNb PREMISE-Statistic 1745 1838 To give you a comparison, when we launched the iPhone, we had about 500 apps that were ready.
v-rhsrJ1Xi PREMISE-Statistic 1839 1886 When we launched iPad, we had about a thousand.
Q5K7U3x7Jf CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1887 2031 And so our internal goal was to be able to beat the thousand level, and we thought it would be great if we were able to do that by a little bit.
c3wsKBRKrs PREMISE-Statistic 2032 2118 And as I mentioned before, we now have over 3,500 apps in the App Store for the watch.
5eWhzMbozJ CLAIM-Reformulated 2119 2200 And so we couldn’t be happier about how things are going from that point of view.
m2CIVILTU0 PREMISE-Fact 2201 2289 We are learning quickly about customer preferences between the different configurations.
F8qIsJr04q PREMISE-Fact 2290 2383 There’s a much larger breadth of possibilities here for customers than in our other products.
b2oBtCV2Yd PREMISE-Fact 2384 2423 And in some cases, we called that well.
qeuFYBT3Xo PREMISE-Fact 2424 2491 In some cases, we’re making adjustments to get in line with demand.
HuIMnnMl0e CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2492 2583 But I’m really confident that this is something we really understand how to do and will do.
MPyYrqERTM CLAIM-Reformulated 2584 2722 And so I’m really happy where we are currently, and happy enough that we’re looking forward to expanding into more countries in late June.
YPhpoiTreu NON-ARG 3111 3156 Of course, we’ve said this several times now.
5nnnG9fiwj CLAIM-Fact 3157 3243 When you look at our current product portfolio, it is much broader than it used to be.
86NKlvefk0 PREMISE-Fact 3244 3294 We’ve now developed two new iPhones over the year.
3luExCFg7o PREMISE-Fact 3295 3334 We were not doing that a few years ago.
9CbZYVNq00 PREMISE-Fact 3335 3355 Developed two iPads.
IC-N4Q-NO_ PREMISE-Fact 3356 3398 And of course now we have the Apple Watch.
fIrYJOyiDK PREMISE-Fact 3399 3500 We’re also developing some core foundational technologies more in house now than we were in the past.
nCR-qTTkKK PREMISE-Fact 3501 3607 And of course we’re also spending ahead of some of the products that will generate revenues in the future.
mqEgQU8S8K CLAIM-Reformulated 3608 3735 So when you combined all these factors, that is the reason why you see these research and development increases year over year.
DEdcDinOlm CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3736 3788 Research and development is the core of the company.
yXt4cqA1IY CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3789 3827 Innovation is the core of the company.
ZWC2gL1zpL PREMISE-Statistic 3828 3996 And we’re very proud of the fact, when you look, for example, at the last two quarters, the first half of 2015, our revenue growth has been higher than our opex growth.
lAGDgb3GI8 PREMISE-Statistic 3997 4231 And when you look at our expense to revenue ratio, which, for the first half of the year, has been 8.2%, it’s lower than it was a year ago, and it’s definitely something that we consider extremely competitive, and we’re very proud of.
uRJuRkBwbQ NON-ARG 291 366  Katie, when you use the word “ramp,” I assume you’re talking about supply?
