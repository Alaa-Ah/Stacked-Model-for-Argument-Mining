hm_LnOPFOs NON-ARG 506 511 Sure.
-yz2ZME3IT CLAIM-Fact 561 610 We do have a bit of lumpiness in our expirations.
kI3zY986oH PREMISE-Fact 1038 1168 So aside from a bit of the lumpiness that you do note and we have from time to time, the execution in the quarter was very strong.
CL4gD9JTYy NON-ARG 512 560 A couple things Walter, which I know you recall.
bryb8ATuWo CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1951 1988 So that's the nature of that comment.
9sxBiwVUyL PREMISE-Fact 1838 1950 And that is where in macro pressure on occasion shows itself first, and then some of that non-annuity lumpiness.
oI8R483JAQ PREMISE-Fact 1673 1837 And so some of that weakness frankly is in the non-annuity and very transactional business, which happened to impact Windows Server a bit more than other workloads.
CNUUh8SeCi PREMISE-RealExample 1513 1672 The way I'd think about that one, Walter, is in general, our premium or enterprise workloads across Windows, SQL, System Center, et cetera, grew double digits.
zgHS2UQ64A PREMISE-Fact 611 675 As I said on the call, this was a big expiration quarter for us.
F-6klwjTE- PREMISE-Fact 676 795 And so on occasion what that does, even with the negative currency impact on C&B, is have a bit of lumpiness over time.
7CuBVJMqrN CLAIM-Fact 796 908 Now that being said, I want to point to the core, which is that renewal rates were very good, and a big quarter.
lzFREFAjCO PREMISE-Fact 909 1037 There was very strong performance on that front, very strong performance in moving customers to annuity as well as to the cloud.
