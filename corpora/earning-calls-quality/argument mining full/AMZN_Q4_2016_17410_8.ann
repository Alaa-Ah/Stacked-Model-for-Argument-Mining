mp1KuVs9Ft NON-ARG 580 648 First, let me talk about revenue just to get that out there as well.
T9mRb7xOqo NON-ARG 649 708 We are guiding to 17% to 25% growth on an FX-neutral basis.
pPDQ71gGqX NON-ARG 709 926 That includes approximately – excuse me, yes, on top of that is approximately 250 basis points or $730 million of FX negative impact which brings the non-FX adjusted rate down to – excuse me, range down to 14% to 23%.
Xuk72lCr5b NON-ARG 927 996 I will also point out that we have the leap year comp from last year.
XH8FWmzq-u NON-ARG 997 1086 Last year, the extra day of leap year was worth 150 basis points to us in our Q1 revenue.
myJMxNhSB4 NON-ARG 1087 1112 This year, that reverses.
v4Zo36MP5q NON-ARG 1113 1159 So we have 150-basis point headwind to growth.
WKHbA03vq1 NON-ARG 1444 1484 We had 26 warehouses we added last year.
nzsDTQM7bG NON-ARG 1485 1532 23 of them were in the second half of the year.
2Iu3djamHi NON-ARG 1533 1640 Digital content, digital video content and marketing stepped up quite a bit in the second half of the year.
ObpxiAb-hE CLAIM-Fact 1641 1690 We continue to invest heavily in those two areas.
Ei1uTWURsE NON-ARG 1691 1842 We also have investments in other Prime benefits from Prime Now to AmazonFresh and of course we are continuing to invest in Alexa and our Echo devices.
I9YKCDD5ic CLAIM-Fact 1160 1209 And that's been factored into our guidance range.
TiYRaQdhZN NON-ARG 1210 1247 But your question was on bottom line.
jBjItQCYZY NON-ARG 1248 1373 So yes, what you are seeing, John, is the continuation of the step-up investment that we saw in the second half of last year.
CGZCejqsXj NON-ARG 1374 1443 I talked about, in prior calls, about the fulfillment center step-up.
ryt7y6fVyv NON-ARG 1843 1940 And finally, I guess, I'd point out India which continues to be a rather large investment for us.
