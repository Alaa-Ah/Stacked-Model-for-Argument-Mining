VxRyCKjAhR CLAIM-Fact 707 796 You have our top verticals correct, and we see a lot of strong growth in those verticals.
QKmVehDkGP PREMISE-Fact 797 878 Our top verticals this time are e-commerce, CPG, retail, and entertainment media.
YJRcgZaPJF CLAIM-Fact 879 927 We do see growth in the other verticals as well.
Zl5C7QqtVS PREMISE-Fact 928 1119 You're right that historically it took us a longer time to break into some of these, particularly travel and auto were things that took us longer, but we are seeing some really nice traction.
zdBLmDXtEb PREMISE-RealExample 1120 1293 I talked about Mary Barra and what she and I did together in New York at Adweek, and we're seeing them not just use the platform for advertising but really use the platform.
S1rTiU_aER PREMISE-RealExample 1294 1389 So earlier this year, they rolled out a car at CES on Facebook video rather than at a car show.
ZcqjFDhGmi PREMISE-Fact 1390 1454 And that was a big moment for us, I think, in the auto vertical.
Mwp0BEpll6 NON-ARG 1455 1516 And we continue to work with them and lots of other partners.
VBuIFWm5Rg CLAIM-Fact 1517 1549 Measurement is really key there.
tTbc7QnhzH PREMISE-Fact 1550 1681 The better we can do with dealers and with auto manufacturers at measuring all the way through the purchase, the better off we are.
Oh63PfiJK_ PREMISE-Fact 1682 1870 And I think they know that people are doing the research for autos and the purchases they make, which is a very long sales cycle on their mobile phone, and they want us to be part of that.
LczKMbPJK4 CLAIM-Fact 1871 1945 Similarly with travel, this is a vertical that we are really investing in.
nHXy-cvHtF PREMISE-Fact 1946 2020 We have rolled out different types of product ads that we think will help.
nXp3O1alWo PREMISE-Fact 2021 2139 So in Q2, we rolled out Dynamic Ads that were specifically focused on the travel vertical, and I'll share one example.
aPl9UJ4JbW PREMISE-RealExample 2140 2257 Celebrity Cruises used these Dynamic Ads for travel on both Facebook and Instagram to increase their online bookings.
k8c4cdtpEE PREMISE-RealExample 2258 2379 They worked with one of our FMPs, StitcherAds, and they created custom audiences who viewed specific itineraries by date.
ubFtxRvxj3 PREMISE-Fact 2380 2560 So they look for people that at a certain date have used specific itineraries and then created Dynamic Ads which showed the available cruises and pricing and had a Book Now button.
5HcGxJ6aZt PREMISE-Statistic 2561 2705 They saw a three times increase in their online bookings and I think those kind of results are made possible by more vertical-specific products,
qYI5PoYdxJ CLAIM-Reformulated 2706 2750 and we're going to continue to invest there.
