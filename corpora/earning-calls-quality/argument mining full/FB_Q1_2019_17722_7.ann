Tqyd6DjiOj NON-ARG 537 646 On the revenue outlook, I’m not exactly sure what you’re getting at with the contemplated regulatory changes.
jJ0R_ABKaw CLAIM-Fact 1330 1600 But I would just note that we are not changing our overall philosophy of continuing to invest aggressively across the business in these important areas like safety, and security and innovation, which are going to play into continued expense growth both in 2019 and 2020.
ud878THVwp NON-ARG 1601 1735 No real change in there; it’s more a question of pacing and better visibility on the pace of head count growth and investment in 2019.
GzjGVQlF5V NON-ARG 1736 1806 But the ultimate end outcome, I don’t think is changing on that front.
sdLzzPSaS1 CLAIM-Reformulated 1807 1931 We’re still expecting to continue to invest aggressively in the business, and that will have an impact on operating margins.
vQGL8mauN3 NON-ARG 1234 1329 In terms of the expense guidance, we don’t have a specific update on a long-term margin target.
U2vadonzRl NON-ARG 647 902 But I did cite that one of the factors in the expected deceleration was the ongoing impact of the evolution of the regulatory landscape from things like GDPR and the number of people, who are opting out of using context from third-party apps and websites.
U9mgUlq03v NON-ARG 903 951 That is going to we expect continue to increase.
vtV5OfRk4d NON-ARG 952 1114 As well as we’re making our own product changes with things like tools for seeing and clearing your off-Facebook history and restricting use of some ad targeting.
uSciFkqRN9 NON-ARG 1115 1197 And some of that is in response to just the evolution of the regulatory landscape.
NnZnYWa9S7 NON-ARG 1198 1233 So, I think it does factor into it.
