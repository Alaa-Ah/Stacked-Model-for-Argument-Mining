VEXkaouJB- NON-ARG 842 858 So this is Phil.
URQq3CmhLm NON-ARG 859 885 I'll take the AWS portion.
LwxPE7FtMC NON-ARG 886 923 So I'll echo what Brian said earlier.
A_SFqa-VHf CLAIM-Fact 924 1087 This is a young and rapidly growing business, and as you've seen looking backwards, certainly growth rates and margins and capital expenditure timing can be bumpy.
F5hwZzkX2J CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1141 1364 We're excited about the potential there, and really the team's focused on just keeping their heads down and continuing to accelerate the pace of innovation to try to continue to grow the functionality gap we think we offer.
CMJNj0BrAE PREMISE-Fact 1811 1984 And some of the expense for things like data centers or new regions can be a little lumpy, and we've mentioned a couple of new regions we're working on throughout the world.
OZS12yVi-o CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1088 1140 We're taking a very long-term view on this business.
xsKH_WASHW CLAIM-Fact 1365 1402 So a lot of hard work going on there.
1GkTy_CWqt PREMISE-Fact 1671 1810 And so, on the AWS side, we've got investment going on around the world, certainly additional servers to support the strong growth we have.
pT9TFnI-AP NON-ARG 2032 2080 Mark, on your head count question, you're right.
2P_7jH5oDk PREMISE-Statistic 2081 2157 Headcount was up 49% year-over-year, which is higher than Q2 â€“ we saw in Q2.
jLu74gZ-dJ CLAIM-Fact 2158 2204 This is going to be primarily in our ops area.
N2aCbK9NB- PREMISE-Statistic 2205 2323 If you exclude ops-related employees, our head count's growing actually slower than our FX neutral growth rate of 30%.
fY3VDQd4xa PREMISE-Statistic 2324 2439 So, what's going on in ops is we've added 14 net fulfillment centers this year, bringing the total to 123 globally.
RoT-sWFD6B PREMISE-Statistic 2440 2513 We've added four sort centers in the U.S., bringing U.S. footprint to 23.
yB8X50Cv9N CLAIM-Fact 2514 2610 We're staffing earlier in those locations, we're in good shape for the holidays and ready to go.
94bCMZD6N- PREMISE-Fact 2611 2750 The other issue is there, the other reason is that we are also doing a lot of conversion of temp workers to full-time workers purposefully.
69eQ91f1M0 PREMISE-Fact 2751 2799 There is a metric employment of full-time hires.
8emBnO_RWD PREMISE-Fact 2800 2849 So it is a little bit higher due to that program.
0VdOsnHZp7 NON-ARG 1985 2012 So that's going on as well.
wIWj9erTl1 CLAIM-Fact 1531 1670 On the CapEx, again, we're focused on the ability to drive efficiencies across all of Amazon, but we're also certainly investing in growth.
lh-omloEzG CLAIM-Reformulated 1403 1530 But again, we're taking a long-term view on the business and interested in helping customers as much as possible in that space.
jgBexjSMYo NON-ARG 150 155  Yes.
