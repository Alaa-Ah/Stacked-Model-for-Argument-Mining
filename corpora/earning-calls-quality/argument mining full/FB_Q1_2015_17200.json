Our goal when we work with marketers is to drive their business, and that means their products off the shelves, their services into the hands of people, and so in order to do that well, we need to work on targeting and we need to work on measurement. So with targeting, a more relevant ad is just better, it's better experience for consumers because they see something they like in their News Feed and it has a higher return for marketers. And so we're very focused on getting more people to use our targeting tools from Custom Audiences which lets people target ads differently to their current customers or people who they'd like to be their customers to look like audiences which enables us to identify the kind of characteristics of your current customers and then find other people on Facebook who share those characteristics so, again, the ad is well targeted. I think our targeting abilities are really second to none, and I'll share a recent example. XFINITY put out a voice guide for visual disabilities, and they did this, they did this by doing an Oscar commercial with a girl who is blind imagining what Wizard of Oz characters looked like. Now by doing that at the Oscars, that's obviously TV and it's a very broad ad and that's because they were both showing a product but also working on their brand. On Facebook, they took that ad and showed it to movie fans, Wizard of Oz fans and also people connected to accessibility causes. That's actually pretty specific targeting that lets them hit exactly the right audience and amplify what they were doing on TV, and I think that's the kind of thing that only we can do at scale, and it shows how important targeting is. When you think about closing the loop, you then have to add in the measurement piece because if we can connect, people seeing ads on Facebook to what they buy, in stores or in other ways, that's how you close the loop and that's why we put so much investment and hopefully so much innovation behind measurement. So conversion tracking is increasingly used, and we work with our marketers to use it even more, and we're also really excited about conversion list because that's the first product we've had which scientifically measures the additional business you get from Facebook ads. It compares test groups that see ads with control groups that don't. So whatever you're measuring in terms of conversions whether it's sales or website clicks or registrations, we can A, B test and see exactly what the impact Facebook has. I think we're still at the beginning of this. I think there is so much more we can do to make ads more relevant on Facebook and so much more we can do to measure results, and I think our future growth will depend on executing on that very well.", "start": 2301, "labels": ["ANSWER"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": true, "created_at": "2022-02-04T10:03:51.595605Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-04T10:03:51.595610Z", "lead_time": null, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "task": 17200, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null}], "data": {"year": 2015, "company": "FB", "my_text": "\nOperator: Your next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS.
