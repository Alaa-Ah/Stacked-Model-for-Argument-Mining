And the uniqueness of Windows comes because we don\u2019t think of these services and their application end points as apps, but fundamentally core to the Windows experience.

Outlook is the email client for Windows. So that\u2019s how Windows will differentiate and not to mention, our Gaming and Xbox Live experiences. So overall, we will build a differentiated Windows because our application experiences for our cloud end points will be native in windows and at the same time, we will make sure that our services are available on all end points driving more usage, more subscription growth.
