And you actually talked a lot in your prepared remarks about how marketers benefit from running digital and TV campaigns in parallel. So I wonder if you could just comment on where your share gains are coming from, in your view. And then, Mark, on Live video, I realize it's a small part of overall video, but I wonder. Do you think multiple platforms can succeed in live streaming over time given the size of the market longer term, or do you think it's more of a network effect business where a vast majority of the traffic and economics will ultimately accrue to the leader in the live streaming space?

I'll give a fun example from the Super Bowl. T-Mobile wanted to use their Super Bowl campaign to increase their brand awareness and increase their reach. So before the game, they targeted their 30-second Super Bowl ad that featured Drake to people with NFL and celebrity interests. It performed so well that they decided to run the 60-second version on Facebook and Instagram.

One interesting example recently that I touched on earlier is between Messenger and WhatsApp, we're around 60 billion messages a day. And SMS at its peak we think was around 20 billion messages a day. And just unlocking some of the friction that existed in SMS and improving the product a little bit and removing the small fee that was there has just unlocked a huge amount of expression. And we think that this is going to be the case in all different types of media and with all different audiences that a person would share it with. So in video, there are billions and billions of videos that are viewed every day on Facebook. Live is a very small part of it. The reason why we give disproportionate attention to it is because we're trying to help push forward new formats that are not just about consuming content but are really about interacting, so Live, 360 video, and there will be others in the future. And so yes, to answer your question, I do think that multiple products and companies can succeed in building these things. I also think that there are going to be a lot more interactive forms of video than just Live and 360 like we're talking about now.
