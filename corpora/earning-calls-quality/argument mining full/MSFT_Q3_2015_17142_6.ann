qrdsmG4AqE CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1009 1073 so it’s really its entirety that we think of as our unique value
XSDjOmrW0_ PREMISE-RealExample 791 1008 I think about the Microsoft Cloud because even the way we do capital, the way we measure utilization is all with the complete unit, which is of course all of Office 365 runs on Azure, Azure AD powers all of our Cloud,
OAD_wjyaZl CLAIM-Opinion(view) 692 790 First of all, I don’t think that of the comparison between Azure and AWS is the true north for me.
Ogcl0aeQIZ CLAIM-Fact 1075 1203 So that means we have SaaS which is a huge component between O 365 and Dynamics, PaaS which is a huge component of Azure itself.
WE1MGnSRiP CLAIM-Fact 1667 1720 And that’s how we want to make sure we make progress,
DMgMPN4xcn PREMISE-Fact 1721 1834 because that’s where both product value which is unique to us and also the quality of revenue that’s unique to us
PigAgDVvit NON-ARG 1480 1524 And then it’s reflected even in our margins.
gnyFdyjdYq NON-ARG 1525 1666 So when we look at our Cloud margins, they will have our revenue quality, which is very different; that’s a combination of past iOS and SaaS.
QKMegYtPd6 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1836 1951 But the one other thing that I – see my world view is not that all compute storage networks just goes to one place.
lXowXDroE- PREMISE-Fact 1952 2108 That’s why I think of our servers as the edge of our Cloud, and as I said there’s a huge software asset in there which is becoming increasingly competitive.
tNjkXoK6Y7 PREMISE-Statistic 2109 2308 Of course we don’t count that in our run rates or when we talk about our $6 billion plus run rate, that’s just pure public Cloud number and that’s fantastic to see and we want to measure it that way.
P4WaZIlsI_ PREMISE-Fact 2309 2484 But quite frankly if you sort of looked at what’s broadly happening in the Cloud transition, we are participating in both the private hybrid Cloud as well as the public Cloud.
jVQz04gdis PREMISE-Fact 1204 1276 We see many customers who would use even our PaaS services and even AWS.
gvLu-h5KwS PREMISE-RealExample 1277 1401 So we – for example, you can in fact do a single sign-on using EMS and Azure AD in Azure and use – so your resources on AWS.
NC7OlOjZSg PREMISE-RealExample 1402 1446 And then of course we have our iOS business.
gEYBxfJ4G1 NON-ARG 1447 1479 So that’s how we think about it.
SdqOMydOIS NON-ARG 2495 2511  Thanks, Walter.
CAdHeCXXcs NON-ARG 2937 2980  We’ll continue to talk generally about it.
ETOWpucQBs NON-ARG 2981 3043 I don’t expect to give specific guidance on FY 2016 next week.
nYVkqDTcqL NON-ARG 3077 3091  Okay, Walter.
