umfSHBoXMB NON-ARG 2210 2223 Oh, pre-roll.
NQaIFCqYrp NON-ARG 2224 2248 I can take that one too.
NSn_AYLmBa CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2249 2317 So we don't think it would be a good experience in News Feed, right,
xs27tNpLs9 PREMISE-Fact 2318 2684 because a lot of when people are finding videos on Facebook is you're scrolling through News Feed, you're looking at what story seems interesting to you, which is why we did the auto play videos so that rather than having to take an action, you can just start experiencing the video automatically and continue watching it if it's something that you're interested in.
xtpmUC7GAw PREMISE-Fact 2685 2809 But if we started playing an ad in the middle of a feed before you got to the video, then that would really go against that.
QRF_xbJd14 PREMISE-Fact 2810 2908 I think people just would watch a lot less of the organic videos that were posted because of that.
u95WGT8-sW CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2909 3006 But the important thing to keep in mind on this is we don't really – we don't need to do pre-roll
KcphC0JVBS PREMISE-Fact 3007 3237 because our model is not one where you come to Facebook to watch one piece of content, you come to look at a feed and putting the ads in between the stories is a much more effective way to do it and better for the user experience.
b0k3PWZwav CLAIM-Fact 972 1192 So we have studied the effect that you're talking about, and published the results of our research that show that Facebook is actually, and social media in general, are the most diverse forms of media that are out there.
Cc5LZmnHz4 PREMISE-Fact 1193 1606 And basically what – the way to think about this is that, even if a lot of your friends come from the same kind of background or have the same political or religious beliefs, if you know a couple of hundred people, there's a good chance that even maybe a small percent, maybe 5% or 10% or 15% of them will have different viewpoints, which means that their perspectives are now going to be shown in your News Feed.
iWhnCZOa_3 PREMISE-Fact 1607 1931 And if you compare that to traditional media where people will typically pick a newspaper or a TV station that they want to watch and just get 100% of the view from that, people are actually getting exposed to much more different kinds of content through social media than they would have otherwise or have been in the past.
M5UwXAlgIn CLAIM-Fact 1932 2018 So it's a good sounding theory, and I can get why people repeat it, but it's not true.
GKvTaQhNLS PREMISE-Fact 2019 2129 So I think that that's something that if folks read the research that we put out there, then they'll see that.
