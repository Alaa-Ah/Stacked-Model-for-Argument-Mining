And so if you, and look at iPhone X in particular, it's the most innovative smartphone on the market. We priced it at a level that represented the value of it and we could not be happier that it has been the top selling iPhone since the launch, and so we feel terrific about iPhone X. If you look at the sort of the top of our line together, and by that I mean the iPhone X, the 8 and the 8 Plus, they are growing very nicely, as you can probably tell from looking at the ASP and we couldn't be happier with how that's gone. And so I think in this cycle, we've learned that customers want innovative products and we sort of already knew that in other cycles and other points in times, but it just puts an exclamation point by that I believe with looking at the results. At the unit level, the iPhone SE had a difficult comp to the year-ago quarter and so, when we changed some of the configurations, memory configurations in the year-ago quarter.

Thank you. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had double digit growth in Greater China. I mentioned how iPhone X and the iPhones are selling. We did pick up share in iPhone and iPad, but if you look more holistically at our complete line, we had double digit growth from services to iPad to iPhone and to our other product category which the watch did extremely well, and so there are lots of good things happening there. In terms of the tariffs themselves, maybe I could sort of take a step back because I'm sure some people have questions on this. And our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences. That said, the trade relationships and agreements that the U.S. has between the U.S. and other major economies are very complex and it's clear that several are in need of modernizing, but we think that in the vast majority of situations that tariffs are not the approach to doing that and so we're sort of encouraging dialogue and so forth. In terms of the tariffs that have been imposed or have exited the comment period \u2013 I think there's one that's exiting today \u2013 there have been three of those and maybe I can walk through those briefly just to make sure everybody is on the same page. The first was the U.S. imposed a tariff on steel and aluminum. That was many, many different countries. That started I believe at the beginning of June. There have been two other tariffs that have totaled about $50 billion of goods from China that have either been implemented or exiting the comment period in this month. I think the latest one is today. If you look at those three tariffs, none of our products were directly affected by the tariffs. There is a fourth tariff which includes goods valued at $200 billion, also focused on goods that are imported from China. That one is out for public comment. Probably like everyone else, we're evaluating that one and we'll be sharing our views of it with the administration and so forth before the comment period for that one ends. It's actually a tedious process in going through it because you not only have to analyze the revenue products, which are a bit more straightforward to analyze, but you also have to analyze the purchases that you're making through other companies that are not related to revenue. Maybe they're related to data centers and this sort of thing and so we're going through that now and we'll be sharing our results later on those and feeding back public comment. Of course the risk associated with more of a macroeconomic issue such as an economic slowdown in one or more countries or currency fluctuations that are related to tariffs is very difficult to quantify. And so that, and we're not even trying to quantify that, to be clear about it. All of this said, we're optimistic, as I've been the whole time, that this will get sorted out because there is an inescapable mutuality between the U.S. and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together, that each country can only prosper if the other does and of course the world needs both U.S. and China to prosper for the world to do well. That said, I can't predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this and we are hoping that calm heads prevail.", "start": 2789, "labels": ["ANSWER"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 6212, "text": "Nancy Paxton", "start": 6199, "labels": ["REPRESENTATIVE"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 6274, "text": ": Thank you, Shannon.
