avWhsRwfRS CLAIM-Opinion(view) 672 676 Yes.
wvxGdncZcm CLAIM-Opinion(view) 677 796 I mean it’s absolute perquisite for us to have entirety of our cloud infrastructure plant drive scale economics for us.
KqTXP7vUNw CLAIM-Fact 797 929 And in fact, a lot of the core Azure technology around machine management and data center management comes out of our bring efforts.
DuEuY6zbCZ PREMISE-RealExample 930 1099 We manage all of the supply chain, all of it is as one supply chain; we do SKU design as one SKU design; we drive costs of both network storage, compute down altogether.

muHVU0b3bo CLAIM-Fact 1320 1427 In fact the first -- the fact that -- I celebrate the fact that we don’t have just one first party workload
V7Yd9vI6LB PREMISE-Fact 1428 1538 because it’s very easy for one first party workload to completely opt if you will the architecture of a cloud.
HTkNJt_Wna CLAIM-Reformulated 1539 1595 But in our case, we have a very diverse set of workload.
vOHCNMnmdC PREMISE-RealExample 1596 1831 We have Xbox LIVE; we have Office 365; we have Dynamics and Bing and that diversity is what allows us to build in fact for our own needs a cloud architecture that then can meet many more workloads and that’s working pretty well for us.
