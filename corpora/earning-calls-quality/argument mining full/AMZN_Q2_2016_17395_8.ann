rmTomKfloj NON-ARG 478 522 I'll comment on the customer accounts again.
nEgTZWaAiw NON-ARG 523 744 We may consider updating that in the future, but really we encourage you and our investors to look at our free cash flow measures, our revenue and our GAAP operating profit since our customer purchasing behavior can vary.
MUUbuVvvCi NON-ARG 763 847  And on Prime penetration, of course, we haven't released Prime subscription levels.
GiEEKcgiMp NON-ARG 848 916 We have talked about growth certainly globally and in North America.
EKnERsPKKq NON-ARG 917 992 What I can tell you there is we still think there's a lot of room in Prime.
KSFalzbJag NON-ARG 993 1029 We've tailored programs to students.
JTqMfebMyl NON-ARG 1030 1060 We've tailored video programs.

baaroAapKd NON-ARG 1093 1129 We have plans with grocery delivery.
VQqGQlIOzc NON-ARG 1130 1243 So there's a lot of different flavors of Prime and we are aggressively looking for a perfect Prime for everybody.
eEIOweiglc NON-ARG 1244 1304 We know that, again, when customers try Prime, they like it.
NUQAjyAJym NON-ARG 1305 1439 So it's really just about getting them to try Prime and continuing to deliver great Prime benefits and great low prices and selection.
