9SuZ9rJrXr PREMISE-RealExample 789 931 We have a very good business in SQL Server, we have perhaps the most competitive SQL Server product ever in SQL 2014, which is growing nicely.
wYgeYQcoeQ PREMISE-Fact 932 1053 But if you look at what is secular in terms of growth going forward, it’s data, data management in a variety of new ways.
uCi62Z3yy5 CLAIM-Fact 421 491 I mean that’s the biggest opportunity is to be able to get into space.
mi_sL6KPZH PREMISE-Other 492 628 I mean one of the things that I always think about it, for all the success we’ve had in our server business, we were a low share player.
JCtm4CBL9d NON-ARG 629 707 And when I look at the total IT spend of that enterprise customers have today.
Xxdssmr2OW NON-ARG 708 788 As I said, we’ve not participated in many, many areas, we got even the data set.
By9k_-dC3x CLAIM-Reformulated 1054 1212 So, those are the opportunities we want to be able to take advantage of by doing some good work both in the public cloud, as well as with our server products.
_LEQ37CAdr CLAIM-Fact 1213 1332 The challenge will always remain at the end of the day for us to make sure that we are bringing together unique offers.
SrEuYa3gA4 PREMISE-Fact 1333 1472 One of the things that I want to ask team to be very focused on is to bring uniqueness that only Microsoft can bring it to the marketplace.
zd3GNMQsFl CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1473 1633 That’s why it is approach around platform and reinvention of productivity, I believe is what we can do that for sure we’re going to have incredible competition.
UaZtyU_i60 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1634 1973 But at the same time, I think that if you ask anyone, at least in our campus whether we deeply get what it means to reinvent productivity I believe do we get deeply how to take the various constituents from end users IT and developers and harmonize their interest in unique ways so that enterprises can adopt solutions, we get that deeply.
kqyTQBVsD7 CLAIM-Reformulated 1974 2154 So, to me staying with that and staying focused on our unique contribution is perhaps are both on opportunity and our challenge and we will obviously index on the opportunity side.
