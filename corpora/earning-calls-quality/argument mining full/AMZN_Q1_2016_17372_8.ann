9wIjdR_Mmc NON-ARG 729 740 Yeah, sure.
sZvfUMBuo4 NON-ARG 741 764 Let me – this is Brian.
Ci-dZ9EhVl NON-ARG 765 809 Let me start with the second question first.
m8eQauVD2t CLAIM-Fact 810 955 It wasn't necessarily the Prime flywheel that was the issue, it was more the FBA demand that we had from FBA sellers for space in our warehouses.
KLE2ylvM_3 PREMISE-Fact 956 974 We were very full.
1k8qR-r8Lp NON-ARG 975 1011 It was a high-class problem to have.
xtbYLZ25kf PREMISE-Fact 1012 1221 But it – as I mentioned last quarter, it did result in higher fulfillment costs in the fourth quarter as a result, and I think you'll see some of that dissipated now in Q1, so you could tell it was a Q4 issue.
ie2_sXDzGy CLAIM-Policy 1222 1272 We learn from every Q4, this one was no exception.
NYqpcRhOZ1 PREMISE-Other 1273 1329 We are already making plans for a smoother Q4 next year.
dsD8QeFLeY NON-ARG 1579 1592 This is Phil.
8hH6L7u6of NON-ARG 1593 1735 On the Prime question, we launched Prime in the U.S. in 2005, followed that in 2007 with U.K., Germany, Japan, and then other countries after.
x2JszRXs7w NON-ARG 1736 1847 We have Prime in all of the countries where we have Marketplaces with the exception of Mexico, China and India.
je_SaKopIS NON-ARG 1848 1905 And Prime is really in varying stages in those countries.
bFUXCLuKQS NON-ARG 1906 1970 We have some kind of an expedited shipping offer in all of them.
wCrO5l3rt1 NON-ARG 1971 2159 Here in the U.S., we've been talking quite a bit about Prime Now, that's also in Italy and Japan and the U.K. at this point and not others, also varying levels of digital benefits as well.
1IoMj-CKbU NON-ARG 2160 2277 So, generally, the international countries are not as far along with selection or the fullness of the digital offers.
VpUEo_sGyO NON-ARG 2278 2334 We've got Prime Video in the U.K., in Germany and Japan.
W6tYew6Aaj NON-ARG 2335 2396 Music is not fully rolled out yet to all of the others there.
mdZYnIBL4W NON-ARG 2397 2431 So that's where we are with Prime.
iygr0ufy0d PREMISE-Other 1330 1564 We will continue to add fulfillment capacity, we will work with FBA sellers on inventory stocking and timing and we think that there's things that we can do better as we do every year, come out of fourth quarter with immense learnings
