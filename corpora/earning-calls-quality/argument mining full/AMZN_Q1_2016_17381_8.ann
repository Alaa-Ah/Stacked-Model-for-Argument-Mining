o3_Gxh9CGP NON-ARG 863 903 I'll take the first question on content.
bSPu9O5o11 NON-ARG 904 908 Yes.
A0tI4gSw05 NON-ARG 909 1122 My comment on Prime benefits was essentially one about video content and our investment there, not saying other investments may not go up as well, but that is the one that we are focusing on and that I called out.
BNatQ2jPGx NON-ARG 1236 1317  ...saturation, yeah, I think that's one of the thoughts behind our monthly plan.
J0U8Z6T2ct CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1318 1420 We want to create flexibility for consumers to try Prime in a low-cost way, if that's how they choose.
7S2xMvRoFa PREMISE-Fact 1421 1572 We've always had our free trial program, but it is a hurdle for many people or there's a hesitancy to put up a full year's payment for a year of Prime.
SljSy5IB-4 PREMISE-Fact 1573 1727 Annual is still going to be a better deal but we know that customers may try it more frequently if it's a monthly plan, and that's what we're looking for.
hhS4zaEqz9 PREMISE-Fact 1728 1798 We know that once customers try it, generally, they'll really like it.
wy9H6e01ro CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1799 1873 So we think that will purge (40:38) some other demographic groups as well.
rzpa1TDyaZ NON-ARG 1887 1900 This is Phil.
kHh9LbR7JI NON-ARG 1901 1926 Another comment on Prime.
R9b-KRhrll PREMISE-Statistic 1927 2156 On your saturation question, keep in mind that even in the U.S., which is our most mature by years of launch, we still grew last year at 47% year-over-year membership growth, and we continue to make the program better and better.
N4H-uP4bwm CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2157 2248 I think the monthly offers are great for flexibility, give people a chance to try new ways.
VvaEaMT4TZ PREMISE-Fact 2249 2280 And we continue to add content.
6AOyX6fC3B PREMISE-Fact 2281 2310 We continue to add selection.
7aS3ps9KD0 PREMISE-Fact 2311 2376 Prime Now is a huge benefit that didn't even exist two years ago.
kz5qiaWEKZ CLAIM-Fact 2377 2492 So all these things are making the program better and we're still out trying to meet as many customers as possible.
ehAgr08IYP CLAIM-Fact 2493 2575 We're obviously very committed to driving Prime and it's important to the company.
Lkd-zp8RyQ NON-ARG 2576 2697 Your question on China, probably the biggest thing to point to is more progress and selection on the Amazon global store.
JG6PdnzppB NON-ARG 2698 2721 So this is our website.
w5YaV46Zqu PREMISE-Fact 2722 2864 This is the offer that allows Chinese customers to shop from the U.S. website, Amazon.com, with prices in RMB and with Chinese-language pages.
tou3tKF4iJ PREMISE-Fact 2865 3002 So it's focused on really items that may be hard to get, and Amazon's really trying to become the trusted source for many of these goods.
jcrynKM8e6 CLAIM-Reformulated 3003 3044 So really that's a big part of the focus.
1Y22zMVedk PREMISE-Statistic 3045 3164 And if you've been tracking that number over time, we're now up over $10 million, which is good progress on that front.
