p2Gr8BncI8 CLAIM-Fact 899 1111 The position that we have taken is that we want to serve customers where they are and not assume very simplistically that the digital sovereignty needs of customers can be met out of a fewer data center approach.
aID7170BDK PREMISE-Fact 1112 1327 Because right now, given the secular trend to move to the cloud across all of the regulated industries across the globe, we think it's wiser for us and our investors long term to be able to meet them where they are.
yXA1_W7vzo NON-ARG 1328 1355 And that's what you see us.
7oQgXwaKKv PREMISE-RealExample 1356 1477 We are the only cloud that operates in China under Chinese law, the only cloud that operates in Germany under German law.
zqs7HkCq-k PREMISE-Fact 1478 1535 And these are very critical competitive advantages to us.
3mATOV1G9T PREMISE-Fact 1536 1597 And so we will track that, and we will be very demand driven.
F-WJqd9LGH PREMISE-Fact 1598 1725 So in this case we're not taking these positions of which regions to open and where to open them well in advance of our demand.
eKq4HYGOpi PREMISE-Fact 1726 1792 If anything, I think our cycle times have significantly come down.
hrHCbNtvVe PREMISE-Fact 1793 1971 So it will be demand-driven, but I don't want to essentially put a cap because if the opportunity arises, and for us it's a high ROI decision to open a new region, we will do so.
BvN4X3LmY7 CLAIM-Fact 1985 2108 And I would add, in addition to the number of regions which Satya is talking about, it's also the capacity inside a region.
YS4xtCRULI PREMISE-Fact 2109 2215 Much of our spend is, as you note, on some of the infrastructure to put in place when you pick a location.
Yk-qIhp_jf PREMISE-Fact 2216 2331 The rest of it is continuing to build out in that location the number of servers and networking equipment required.
IqdZdS6ylI PREMISE-Fact 2332 2548 So there are really two components, and I think Satya has talked about why you would enter a region and its ROI, and there's also the correlation to how many servers and that spend and pace over time based on demand.
VCXCQnQlRz CLAIM-Fact 3052 3137 In terms of server products and services, I tend to think of it as the all-up growth.
DTGrccrmzk CLAIM-Fact 3138 3259 It's really about growing the cloud, growing the hybrid, and then whatever happens in the Transactional business happens.
HX-viVXhxB CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3260 3315 And I'm very proud actually of the growth this quarter.
cbLUAoNYv8 CLAIM-Value 3316 3564 I think our guide for Q1, given some of the headwinds we expect in terms of support agreements that we talked about in Enterprise Services, continues to expect very healthy double-digit annuity growth, driven fundamentally by Azure in that segment.
Z7anGfaCEz NON-ARG 608 657 Let me start, and then, Amy, you can add to this.
VjCIgtCf4d NON-ARG 658 898 In some sense, Ross, you're trying to ask us to project forward and say what is the legitimate digital security and digital sovereignty needs of all the different types of businesses that we want to serve using the cloud all over the world.
otGEMEQDOV NON-ARG 3575 3589  Thanks, Ross.
