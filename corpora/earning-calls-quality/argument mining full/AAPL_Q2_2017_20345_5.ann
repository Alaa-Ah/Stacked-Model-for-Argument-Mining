8xVbIixlIt NON-ARG 3331 3536 Rod, the way that we think about pricing is we come up with a price that we think is a good value for the product that we're delivering, and we do that on the hardware side as well as on the Services side.
06XGUVY4FE NON-ARG 3537 3573 And so that's how we think about it.
fX-umw4brI NON-ARG 3574 3667 We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to subsidize the other or vice-versa.
ifdpuEci3x NON-ARG 557 580 Yes, I'll take it, Rod.
huQwM7lqmB NON-ARG 581 632 We don't disclose into the number of subscriptions.
k-wmMzABfq NON-ARG 633 718 Of course, we're just giving you the total count of subscriptions that are out there.
sq3Hx7YkTj CLAIM-Opinion(view) 929 1042 But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in.
iP6svfr7Z9 PREMISE-Fact 719 806 Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services.
XgaR6A_XjD PREMISE-Fact 807 928 There is some level of overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very, very large, obviously less than 165 million.
ycx3Mg1E8- PREMISE-Fact 1043 1063 It's a large number.
DwxvbpwXVr PREMISE-Statistic 1064 1157 And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we talked about 150 million.
vAnclfeiDQ PREMISE-Statistic 1158 1360 So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores.
f_UHVWKcuk PREMISE-Fact 1361 1426 It's quite impressive to add 15 million subscriptions in 90 days.
a2WrPGNtzc CLAIM-Fact 1588 1647 We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot.
9-JLQkQGJd PREMISE-Fact 1648 1776 And I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we value in this last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had.
9mGIOyW-Nc PREMISE-Fact 1777 2057 So this very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on our stores, and that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits.
2OY3sp6Hg3 NON-ARG 1427 1587 As we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores, particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently two things.
C9C1aY8MnG CLAIM-Fact 2058 2174 What we're also seeing as we look at people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time.
OGOK9b-Pyg PREMISE-Fact 2175 2368 And we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world.
s6eKJYxNfx PREMISE-Fact 2369 2444 People start at a certain level and then they tend to spend more over time.
q5PqW8XqTC CLAIM-Value 2445 2675 And so obviously, the combination of people spending more over time and adding more people that are now actually spending on the stores contributes to this 40% growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year-over-year basis.
ioQWVLMtAp NON-ARG 3726 3731  Yes.
zckKvgUtov NON-ARG 3745 3758  Thanks, Rod.
KEpLQSHzdM NON-ARG 3759 3799 Could we have the next question, please?
