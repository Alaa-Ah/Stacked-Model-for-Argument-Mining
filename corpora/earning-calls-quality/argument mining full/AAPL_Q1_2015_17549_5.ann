zb_okW7rkw CLAIM-Fact 533 591 on Apple TV, we had a solid quarter with existing product.
r1Cmkg32eo PREMISE-Statistic 592 802 We’ve sold 25 million Apple TVs now which at the sake of repeating myself, it’s something that we continue to look at and work on and find a way that we can make even greater contribution than what we’re doing.
vIh2lxOMRr CLAIM-Opinion(view) 803 880 On Apple Pay, both the contactless payment and the in app are both important.
Oi_eRkPR0v CLAIM-Reformulated 881 922 I think they are both huge opportunities.
M0ygkIQaSN PREMISE-Fact 1284 1352 There's tons of things on our roadmap of adding functionality to it.
iYfPEWpP_k PREMISE-Fact 1353 1582 We’re obviously -- we're just in the U.S. right now and so there's tons of countries to go to and there is not a day that goes by that I don’t get notes from many businesses outside U.S. running Apple Pay and banks and merchants.
eMmup8U0K_ PREMISE-Fact 1583 1646 And of course we still have a lot of merchants left in the U.S.
RVbmOZJsCD CLAIM-Reformulated 2035 2075 But I think we’re just on the front end.
EtMAzq3ow0 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2076 2123 And I think that this is the year of Apple Pay.
i_rDZ2U4fM NON-ARG 2124 2271 And some of the things you mentioned and others are all things that we’re looking at and in many cases working on in terms of where it can take us.
8UuuyisUfl CLAIM-Opinion(view) 923 1155 I think they’ll play out differently in different geographic regions as to which one is larger than the other and well likely -- the mix of those things will change over time as more and more commerce flows across apps and so forth.
mHlzigKZcD CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1647 1859 But I have to tell you that given that we’ve launched in October, I'm actually unbelievably shocked, positively shocked at how many merchants were able to implement Apple Pay in the heart of their holiday season,
jWcDxwr_ZM CLAIM-Reformulated 1932 2034 But we were able to get this in a lot of different merchants and I give them a lot of credit for that.
NxITF-zBXT PREMISE-Fact 1860 1931 because generally most people sort of lock down and don’t do very much.
fn6JmbSVFn CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1156 1224 In terms of how it evolves, I think we're in the first inning on it.
YOoeCSmMPi CLAIM-Reformulated 1225 1283 I'm not -- we haven’t even completed the first inning yet.
