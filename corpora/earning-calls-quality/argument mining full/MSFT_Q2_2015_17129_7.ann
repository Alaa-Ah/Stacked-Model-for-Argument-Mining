Yshwm3GXYi CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3376 3433 I think it's definitely expanding the market opportunity.
Izfi4AoGoy PREMISE-Fact 3434 3722 One of the things that I feel very good about is the risk we took to introduce the two-in-one category and I feel now that we see that in fact inspire even a lot of activity in our own OEM ecosystem and we see many good designs coming because it's viewed as a category that drives growth.
2pjXk6MJTU CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3723 3777 And so from that perspective I feel good about leading
p4DHBuw8Av PREMISE-Fact 3778 3908 because that's one of our strategic goals, which is we want to create new categories, foster more demand for the entire ecosystem.
JjmMKl7SHh NON-ARG 800 813 Thanks Keith.
L0LtgcIxs4 NON-ARG 814 950 I'll take the opportunity actually to do it for both Pro as well as non-Pro because I wasn’t sure which category you were talking about.
j1vp6wtUh3 NON-ARG 951 1320 Let me start at the highest level, which is if I work at industry analyst as well as many of our peers in the ecosystem, I actually think we agree with most of the benchmarks in terms of PC unit health across business, which has been stable since FY '13 and across consumer where we see meaningful progress made in unit growth both last quarter and especially this one.
5-iq1eRUhV NON-ARG 1321 1437 So then I'll take a second and talk about sort of the distinction between the revenue growth versus the unit growth.
FPbc3HcCxc NON-ARG 1438 1464 Let me start first in Pro.
o7LPvIhLh6 NON-ARG 1465 1581 There they're really two key dynamics, the first is the return to the XP levels that we saw prior to the XP refresh.
cxwyiXlgdg NON-ARG 1582 1719 They're consistent, the dynamic mix in terms of emerging markets and developed as well as enterprise sizing is not an ASP problem in Pro.
YCVNFzILZh NON-ARG 1720 1769 It is a return to the attach level we saw before.
C--mLoqfrF NON-ARG 1770 1998 The component that actually has impacted -- the second component in Pro that is a quote unquote “ASP/mix comment” is the academic licenses that I referred to earlier where we did lower the price and saw an increased unit number.
fELsfu9IaM NON-ARG 1999 2134 So that was a second component of the revenue piece, but the larger component was the XP reversion and again that's not an ASP comment.
k-y5vQwzjH PREMISE-Statistic 2135 2505 When you come to non-Pro, I think this really refers back to Satya's comments, which is we saw device growth in low price devices opening price points, we actually made I believe a strategic decision to increase our ability to put devices on the shelf, especially at retail at prices under $200 to $249 is how to think about the price points that were the most impacted.
GGljyQdExt NON-ARG 2506 2554 We do have the Windows with things skewed there.
Bi5yHcq1UG PREMISE-Statistic 2555 2729 It is a lower RPL than our traditional non-Pro OEM licenses, but I do believe it drove meaningful ecosystem health and as well drove good competitive dynamics in the channel.
vDoRRidwvk CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2730 3009 And so overall while it did have an RPL impact, which does explain along with mix shift, the minus 13% in non-Pro OEM versus the PC license growth that we saw, I think really Satya covered the actual logic to that in terms of overall ecosystem health as we feel quite good about.
HJqBqTocnM NON-ARG 3968 3979  Thank you.
YTjhaIIGdr NON-ARG 3990 4036  We'll take the next question please operator.
