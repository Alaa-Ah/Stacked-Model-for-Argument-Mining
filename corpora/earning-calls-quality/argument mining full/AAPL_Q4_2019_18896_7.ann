C7IyxjehA3 PREMISE-Statistic 1487 1645 And as I've mentioned before, 3 out of 4 customers buying an Apple Watch currently or last quarter I should say were buying an Apple Watch for the first time.
ylxrdu829b PREMISE-Fact 1411 1486 We haven't seen enough upgrade cycles to really establish a pattern as yet.
ItMi8fV8q7 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1360 1410 I think we, because the Watch is relatively young.
HhA7iGN8ME CLAIM-Reformulated 1646 1721 And so there is still a very, very large new to Apple Watch in this regard.
CL6I3Ly2LD CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1850 1924 On the AirPods we're anxious to see the customers for the new AirPods Pro.
NiBwdfoR06 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1924 2106 But I would guess that one particularly in the early going will be people that have AirPods today and want to have -- also have a pair for the times that they need noise cancellation

GMQKAxYSWm CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1721 1849 I do think the upgrade market will look at larger over time, but just don't have a current view as to -- how often and so forth.
