DrIU3lmaB3 NON-ARG 767 772 Okay.
OPlhVoROWk NON-ARG 773 778 Sure.
-b2a_ZtAsh NON-ARG 779 792 Thanks, Mark.
x_LZprrU7n NON-ARG 793 842 I will start with Fresh and groceries in general.
ebG0p71B_6 PREMISE-Fact 843 927 So yes, this quarter we launched in Northern Virginia, Maryland, Dallas and Chicago.
I6J_dd9AQn PREMISE-Fact 928 1074 We also launched a new pricing plan which is a monthly $14.99 add-on to Prime in the U.S. and we've expanded, as you know, previously into London.
kXLejvmEQr CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1075 1275 We're very happy with the progression, both in the geographies that we've been in for a long time where we're at, continuing to add zip codes and additional neighborhoods and also in these new cities.
tZdd6Gmten NON-ARG 1276 1445 Certainly a business where we continue to work on costs and profitability, but we are finding it's a very attractive service to our customers, which is what we're after.
F973twqLLu NON-ARG 1446 1563 Similarly, but not exactly the same is the Prime Now business, which has similar overlap on things besides groceries.
0OmSoXUVtp NON-ARG 1564 1697 It's a slightly different model obviously where we're more about immediacy and a smaller list of items available in one to two hours.
fYlX1N9CTa PREMISE-Statistic 1791 1876 And that is now up to 40 cities across seven countries versus 17 this time last year.
Rjeki9ZUGJ PREMISE-Statistic 1877 2028 We're also adding restaurant, Amazon Restaurant Delivery to the Prime Now offer in 19 metropolitan cities in the U.S. and that's up from two last year.
7dVrBhFZRR CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2204 2304 So we're very happy with the AmazonFresh and we've now expanded quite a bit as you see in this year.
z0JgsK9I0l NON-ARG 2559 2568 Hi, Mark.
LJtQdhphd1 NON-ARG 2569 2583 This is Darin.
wn4_F_NJnR CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2584 2708 On fashion, yeah, fashion and apparel continue to be a large part of our EGM business and one that we're very excited about.
czkGi4QRwB CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2305 2544 And Prime Now, we're also very happy with, although obviously the economics in that business are even tougher, but we do feel that our scale makes that possible because of the geographic footprint and how close we already are to customers.
jxCd6uxDeL CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2029 2203 So we continue to believe consumables, groceries are a key part of the offer to customers and we are playing with very different models to see which works and for what needs.
yvMP0SHxps NON-ARG 1698 1790 But there's certainly a lot of people who are using that for groceries and consumable items.
HPHWcbrNQS NON-ARG 2708 2802  We continue to make it easier for brands and manufacturers to come on board in that category.
eFTGzXyQDw NON-ARG 2803 2917 We continue to work with brands to come on board and we're happy with the traction we're seeing with those brands.
aoakmbTrtN NON-ARG 2918 3195 And as we get more and more selection, we're really pleased with the customer engagement that we have there, both from the discoverability, the technology that goes behind making it easier to shop for fashion on our site as well as the increased selection by adding the brands.
