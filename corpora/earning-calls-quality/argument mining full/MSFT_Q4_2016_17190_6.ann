SmEsKZ1Wo- CLAIM-Opinion(view) 509 592 I do believe that every conversation that we're having with customers is cloud-led.
hJeQ5YeCc6 CLAIM-Fact 932 1025 And so I'm sure there are examples where that has elongated the sales cycle, for good reason.
nX6sc8WCam PREMISE-Fact 1026 1269 But I would generally point back and say most of these are driven at the structural level, which is â€“ structurally over time, on-premises Transactional business will move to the cloud or to a hybrid structure through an annuity revenue stream.
WFhHnQTV_o PREMISE-Fact 1270 1558 Now over any short-term period, the majority of what we have seen is really either a budget constraint, a macroeconomic change, or people, to the question you've laid out, maybe in the midst of making their cloud transition plan, and maybe that has elongated the sales cycle to an extent.
T78glnK0ra NON-ARG 457 508 It's probably not exactly how I would say it, Mark.
gLMGcEUO68 PREMISE-Fact 593 931 That cloud-led conversation and making a plan for customers to best change and transform their own business certainly is a far more in-depth one than on occasion is required by long-time Transactional purchasers, especially in Office, as an example, because what we're talking about now is really pivoting your business for the long term.
YiroQ7AoFY CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1559 1612 But again, I don't view that as negative performance.
QtQNHxmt0i CLAIM-Reformulated 1613 1685 I view that as strategic relevance long term inside of digital accounts.
