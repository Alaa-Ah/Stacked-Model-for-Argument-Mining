MFKwfR0f0z NON-ARG 717 772 Sure, Mark, and let me start and then Amy, you can add.
ZMhWHOzaa2 CLAIM-Fact 773 944 On the Dynamics 365, we're at the very, very beginning phase of the transition of Dynamics from primarily being on-premise to now being a very modern modular SaaS service.
m_O2gE7q0w PREMISE-Fact 945 985 The Dynamics 365 momentum is picking up.
GLPfaSOsKm PREMISE-Fact 986 1130 I talked about the revenue growth rate, and that's definitely going to be what's going to be true in the quarters to come and the years to come.
H0eLFDaPpn PREMISE-Fact 1131 1169 But we do have a huge on-premise base.
8OuMebUcb- PREMISE-Fact 1170 1222 There is still a need for those on-premise products.
7XVhGGauOl CLAIM-Fact 1223 1290 That will continue, but our focus is on transitioning to the cloud.
rgNZUsafIm PREMISE-Fact 1291 1347 And you've seen us do this successfully with Office 365.
YlHZWxgOOl PREMISE-Fact 1348 1382 You've seen us do that with Azure.
U4Pj9RpnBQ CLAIM-Reformulated 1735 1774 So that's what's happening in Dynamics.
oJgXavCYxh CLAIM-Fact 1775 1846 Same thing on Azure, which is – the driver is – a lot of it is net new.
W-ruU8AHQI CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1383 1539 And now we're ready to do that mainstream across what has been traditionally known as CRM and ERP without in fact us thinking and talking about those suites
hPTWRu4VtC PREMISE-Fact 1540 1734 because we think that is a pretty old concept to have suites like that, which is we have now really made the entire Dynamics 365 much more modular, modern, and much more efficient for customers.
e4lw7RvPZ2 PREMISE-Fact 1847 1954 IoT, for example, was not a workload on the old server world, whereas it's one of the big workloads for us.
HwIUOn41Rv PREMISE-Fact 1955 1995 Same thing with AI, not an old workload.
XKuY0-_pGB PREMISE-Fact 1996 2027 So there's new growth in Azure.
VquZ4Km8Ke CLAIM-Fact 2028 2132 There is the lift, shift, and modernize motion as well, as well as a new need for the edge of the cloud.
0E0GSirgO- PREMISE-Fact 2133 2246 So all three of them are in play, while recognizing we had a large business called the Server Licensing business.
Ip-sHc3AlR PREMISE-Fact 2247 2383 So we have three new things that we're driving and a lot of large licensing pieces that are just transitioning into these three motions.
eKkjZfl83H CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2397 2612 And in particular, in this quarter, how to think about I think some of the in-period outperformance versus what we see consistently, in the bucket of consistently, premium workload growth has been consistent for us.
PX4L106He_ PREMISE-Other 2613 2779 The double-digit annuity growth has been consistent for us, and that I think is a driver we continue to look for and be confident in its execution quarter to quarter.
xUFUG4759F CLAIM-Fact 2780 2937 In the more temporal bucket this quarter as well as last you saw a bit of it, some geo help in certain geos that may see and be more transactional in nature.
SzqM6bReCX PREMISE-RealExample 2938 2976 Japan happens to be one of those geos.
qejc8JtV28 PREMISE-RealExample 2977 3160 And then we are still seeing some post-launch impact, specifically on the Windows Server side and selling higher-end SKUs post-launch, which has to do with some of the value inherent.
6dF_obEq0V NON-ARG 3161 3206 So that's how I break down the drivers, Mark.
TVuYEOeuhZ NON-ARG 3289 3297  Thanks.
gzZgsbxYoE NON-ARG 3308 3325  Thank you, Mark.
