GK9ZuhTebf CLAIM-Fact 839 907 The value that we care about here is helping to build common ground.
6hiBoS74gN NON-ARG 977 997 So what we're doing.
J8GPzLbda9 PREMISE-Fact 998 1151 With this specific change which is one of a number of News Feed changes that are geared at improving the quality and trustworthiness of news on Facebook.
TAwar1rdk4 PREMISE-Fact 1152 1248 What we basically ask people we don't want to assess by ourselves which sources are trustworthy.
ij7PiXnMzm NON-ARG 1249 1336 I think that's not a situation that our position that we're comfortable with ourselves.
4nxKt3a4_u NON-ARG 1337 1437 And I don't think personally that that's something that our community or our society wants us to do.
Z6ZOVn_fV2 NON-ARG 1438 1588 So for all of the feedbacks that we get that we should take more of a view on that, I actually – I don't believe that that is the right thing broadly.
8llAH0F5FC CLAIM-Fact 1589 1660 What we try to do is get our community to tell us what matters to them,
ZDFDc2VR1n PREMISE-Fact 1661 1758 because we believe that we can get an accurate signal from the community then – people are smart.
3kb3dQ_-qj PREMISE-Fact 1759 1892 They know what they want and what's good and they can tell us that, if we can ask them in a simple enough way and get aggregate data.
-lohg-kvku CLAIM-Reformulated 1893 2024 So what we're doing here is we basically are just asking people, if they're familiar with news sources and whether they trust them.
MdvA3WLN_j PREMISE-Fact 2025 2193 And the effect of that is that it basically normalizes for – there are going to be people who read a given news source, who will probably trust it because they read it.
a2Z0PtXUJl NON-ARG 2194 2397 But the question is that the people who don't read it, who are still familiar with it, do they think it's trustworthy, and that's the example that I gave before the Wall Street Journal or New York Times.
FBi0WcTrXz NON-ARG 2398 2534 A lot of people read those, a lot of people don't, but the people who don't still think that they're high quality journalism in general.
orBUjV_iHA NON-ARG 2535 2601 And that's not true for a lot of the other stuff that's out there.
hrTFjVV4ZN PREMISE-Fact 2602 2828 And we've found that that's the reliable signal of content that helps to build common ground that is unlikely to be polarizing, that is unlikely to be false news, and what we're doing is helping to show that a little bit more.
fMF7Bq_vtr CLAIM-Fact 2829 2904 Again, we're not going to tell you that you can't share other stuff, right.
K76kiECzOj PREMISE-Fact 2905 2938 You can share it on the platform.
UlC-AcmBAU PREMISE-Fact 2939 2969 People can go to your profile.
jaNtKe3SBr CLAIM-Reformulated 2970 3152 But in News Feed, we're going to just show that a little bit more to do what we view as our role is helping to build common ground, encounter some of these other forces in the world.
