URuP5Z98Zs CLAIM-Fact 696 924 So on Search, we already have one very big use case which is people basically using our search engine to look out pages and people who are on Facebook and that by itself is already one of the biggest search engines in the world.
wUyP2mNCXW CLAIM-Opinion(view) 925 1118 The next big use case that we've really been working on for a couple of years now and I think is going to â€“ is starting to roll out and is growing quickly is people finding content on Facebook.
5nFLtfvjBU CLAIM-Reformulated 1119 1138 So that's trending.
AXzAA7ra9H PREMISE-Fact 1139 1273 It's people finding post that their friends or others had posted in News Feed that they saw but then might want to go check out later.
0Z4m7qkcZl CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1274 1360 And I think this is going to be a very important part of the video experience as well,
KXNcSj8x3S PREMISE-Fact 1361 1484 because one half is pushed, right, going to News Feed and not asking for content but just coming across and discovering it.
jfXCGiNtIm PREMISE-Fact 1485 1711 And then the other half is pull, right, and going to some experience where you're asking for some type of content and getting to a point where we can do that very well is just going to add a whole new dimension to the service.
TgQQzRwBLg NON-ARG 1712 1760 So that's something I remain very excited about.
gzXxOzREpv NON-ARG 1761 1869 In some ways, it's taken a little bit longer than I'd expected to get to a point where it's growing quickly.
ziAVEJQCOF NON-ARG 1870 2005 The people and page lookup part is doing very well, the post part has taken a bit longer but I'm very excited about that going forward.
bCgDXf8nDl NON-ARG 2006 2133 In terms of news, I mean the biggest issue with news today in Facebook is that it is the slowest part of the experience, right?
GOlxNSyXp9 CLAIM-Fact 2134 2226 When you go to load a video and it loads quickly, we made it auto-play to load even quicker.
A5YMsUkCr3 PREMISE-Statistic 2227 2451 You tap on a photo, you expect it to expand immediately, but you tap on a link, and often it can take 10 seconds to load and if you're on a 2G connection somewhere in the developing world, that could take 30 seconds to load.
SDQjEgXSjc CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2918 3117 So I think that that's going to be a really big deal for improving the experience of reading news on Facebook and it's something that we've been working on for a while, and I'm very excited about it.
0BEem1t0IL PREMISE-Fact 2720 2917 And it can be a much more immersive experience and we've already found from the initial experiments that we've done that the engagement is positive and we're starting to roll that out more broadly.
9GjnY95w7n PREMISE-Fact 2452 2719 So the big initiative that we have here which I'm really excited about is Instant Articles and the big thing that that does is just it lets publishers basically put the content on our servers ahead of time and that way when people tap on it, it loads instantaneously.
lzTatIIwzQ NON-ARG 3118 3596 So, yeah, I would expect that we will see an expansion of sharing and consumption of all of the different types of things that you asked about: news, video, search and the different experiences there, and these are some of the big areas that we're investing in and they're long-term investments and they're big investments and we're going to keep on pushing on them, but I think that's what we need to do to serve our community well and ultimately connect everyone in the world.
