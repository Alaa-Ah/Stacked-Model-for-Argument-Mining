vCGsXT_ATS NON-ARG 3009 3153 And, Lloyd, you asked about why the good work that we've done so far in basically providing value for advertisers is playing through into price.
4ZpQGMch5u NON-ARG 3154 3186 Look, that's not just happening.
qIuwbAFVR7 PREMISE-Fact 3187 3318 That's a bunch of hard work that goes into making our ads more targeted that makes the outcomes that advertisers get more valuable.
QlczFt7bPs CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3319 3527 We're going to continue to work to do that, and we're going to continue to invest in making improvements in the ad products, and we think there are great opportunities to continue to make improvements to ROI.
0Hdfxdz77k PREMISE-Fact 3528 3720 But obviously, if you have rising prices, it's going to make that work against an upstream trend, so we need to continue to work hard to deliver more value for advertisers in the face of that.
ghLUM2R6-4 NON-ARG 3721 3823 So we've got our work cut out for us, and we think we've got a great team working on those challenges.
GYSRpCpNUG NON-ARG 906 921 I'll take this.
OYFkiVBFWH NON-ARG 922 980 So, there have been a number of questions about Messenger.
nD3ei0umam NON-ARG 981 1096 And in general, we're seeing – I'm happy with the rate of growth in the experiences that we're seeing on Messenger.
juTWd8PRSN PREMISE-Fact 1097 1284 But if there's one message here that I think is actually important to say, it's that we're trying to communicate that the pace of growing the Messenger business, it's a longer-term thing.
mDtxnuLz5g CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1285 1450 I actually think over the next couple of years or few years, the much bigger driver of the business and determinant of how we do is going to be video, not Messenger.
-YHlza_Xct CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1451 1579 Messenger, I think, is a really important thing and WhatsApp over a three- to five-year period, and we're investing a lot in it.
WPF0ALYs_t PREMISE-Fact 1580 1612 I think it's a huge opportunity.
nNV8ConLLt PREMISE-Fact 1613 1881 But as has been noted on the call, video is both at large scale and the economics are quite different from the current feed-based businesses that we have today, especially around how, with mid-roll ads and rev share around that, the margin structure will be different.
9OG5dYcAty NON-ARG 1882 2050 So, I mean, one of the big questions that we're focused on as we build this out, we're very committed to building it out because it's what people in the community want.
jdeQzRjp3b NON-ARG 2051 2387 But one of the big things that we're really very focused on is making sure that we get this right so that even though this business will likely be – not likely, I think almost certainly will be a lower margin source of revenue than the current thing that we do, there's this big question of how incremental is that behavior going to be.
ZzBlflmL1j NON-ARG 2388 2688 And I'm just throwing this context out there because so many of the questions here today have been about Messenger, and I want to make sure on these calls that we do an accurate and a full job of conveying what we're actually thinking about as a business and what we think the outlook is going to be.
wE0KgADEZe CLAIM-Reformulated 2689 2991 And I think that those questions around video, which I'm optimistic about, but there are real questions there that we need to manage well, is going to be a much bigger driver of the business over the next two to three years likely even than the trajectory of what we're doing on Messenger and WhatsApp.
kAEnWjWGYd NON-ARG 3841 3890  Operator, we're going to take one last question.
