So I'll talk about sharing, and then I think Dave can probably talk about ad loads and pricing. So, the overall level of sharing is up on Facebook. And what we're seeing is that how people share is evolving as we move from desktop to mobile, right. So you can imagine more photos on people's mobile cameras, fewer long full photo albums, more ability to capture video, probably a little bit harder to type on mobile. So there's this evolution. The other thing that we see is that now people have tools to share more privately as well. So when you think about sharing on Facebook, you shouldn't just think about the kind of sharing that you see in News Feed, right. So sharing with all of your friends, sharing in groups on Facebook and public sharing, which are the trends that I was just talking about. But another area that's growing incredibly quickly is private messaging, right, where between Messenger and WhatsApp, I think we're around 60 billion messages a day, which I think is something like three times more than the peak of global SMS traffic. So that is something that's growing pretty quickly and that we're really excited about as well.
