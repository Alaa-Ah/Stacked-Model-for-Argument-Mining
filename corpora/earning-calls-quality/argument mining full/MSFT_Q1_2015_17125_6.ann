PQArdJcGVx PREMISE-Statistic 932 1127 The first and the largest issue is the end of the Nokia commercial agreement that’s about $650 million that we earned in Q2 of a year ago that because of the ended the agreement simply goes away.
ncKNLPjuKU NON-ARG 1128 1159 So, I’ll start with that point.
ixuGe6gIiG PREMISE-RealExample 1160 1298 The second component relates to the same trend we saw in our IP business that we saw in Q4 then in Q1, we’re doing and seeing again in Q2.
GJMX_NHJ8C NON-ARG 1299 1362 So, I would also see that exact same trend line and assessment.
5XVGxSuWvq PREMISE-RealExample 1363 1532 The next component which is a change is we have actually launched some of our Office 365 consumer services in Japan, which is a Geo that we had not been in historically.
