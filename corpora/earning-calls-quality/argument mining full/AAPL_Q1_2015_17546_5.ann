QCwidkdMzg CLAIM-Opinion(view) 402 514 You can see from the March guidance that we’ve given, that we are incredibly bullish about iPhone going forward.
sEMYDq4SN- CLAIM-Reformulated 515 569 We believe that it’s the best smartphone in the world.
IXPmNd3HKb PREMISE-Fact 570 604 Our customers are telling us that.
sDPVkDoEXR PREMISE-Fact 605 635 The market is telling us that.
mSRkUeanPO PREMISE-Fact 636 692 We’re doing well in virtually every corner of the world.
8cK_ekipkZ CLAIM-Reformulated 693 742 And so we’re very bullish that it does have legs.
tj02RED2Vx CLAIM-Fact 824 884 And so there is a lot more people within the installed base.
rIT-qlBJXO CLAIM-Reformulated 1232 1347 And so we see that we’re appealing to new customers, both new to smartphone and new to iPhone and people switching.
KsvKxCDj52 CLAIM-Reformulated 1348 1458 We’re very bullish on the product and getting great feedback about the quality of the products we’re shipping.
XV7bRo62vg CLAIM-Reformulated 1459 1491 And so we’re very, very bullish.
rkuF1ikdqd CLAIM-Fact 1492 1602 The emerging markets which has been a source to great questions over time, the growth was absolutely stunning,
ItLcCwZkdA PREMISE-RealExample 1603 1731 in Brazil and Mainland China more than doubling year-over-year which is 3x to 4x what those markets were doing according to IDC.
M4Fo4-5-WZ CLAIM-Fact 1732 1789 And so we enter the quarter with quite a bit of momentum.
5iS-an6nYx PREMISE-Fact 885 1008 But I would also point out that we had the highest number of customers new to iPhone last quarter than in any prior launch.
p-cq4nGvOZ PREMISE-Fact 1009 1158 And also that the current iPhone line up experienced the highest Android switcher rate in any of the last three launches in the three previous years.
jIZeWdoLRB NON-ARG 1159 1202 And we didn’t look back to the other years.
KFqhTEQQqe NON-ARG 1203 1231 So I don’t know about those.
PkQq3ntK5n CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2922 2991 we feel slightly very good about where we are right now in the cycle.
jjbIV0LCUk PREMISE-Statistic 2877 2921 Having said all that guiding 38.5% to 39.5%,
71ucqfpJAi CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2748 2876 So you obviously have that loss of leverage, but without a doubt the biggest headwind that we got right now is foreign exchange.
IVWTQ8B2hA PREMISE-Fact 2521 2648 The other element that is there and it’s very seasonal, it’s always there, it’s the loss of leverage that we got from Q1 to Q2.
oK_kNmE1TN PREMISE-Statistic 2649 2747 When you look at our revenue guidance, we are guiding to a sequential decline between 26% and 30%.

f9ePJUChNk PREMISE-Statistic 2261 2400 The foreign exchange headwinds as I was explaining to Shannon, they will be on a sequential basis a headwind of more than 100 basis points.
QK56mihmj5 NON-ARG 2229 2260 It goes with our product cycle.
EWQGe1b3pD CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2127 2228 We certainly expect more favorable cost in the March quarter than we’ve seen in the December quarter.
Hlx4eZQh4r PREMISE-Hypothesis 2401 2520 So if you were to exclude that foreign exchange impact, we would actually be guiding to sequential increase in margins.
