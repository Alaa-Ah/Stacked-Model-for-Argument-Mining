RvqfWgd-mL CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1078 1322 It's too early to see any direct impact, but I think it's part of the innovation that you'll see from us as we continue to roll out different ways that marketers can use our tools, different ways they can pay, different results they can target.
vNiActjBOs CLAIM-Fact 1323 1391 When you look at our overall growth, our growth is very broad-based.
sA6pgV-9Hg PREMISE-Fact 1392 1502 We're broad-based against all of our segments of marketers, so brand and direct response, SMBs and developers.
