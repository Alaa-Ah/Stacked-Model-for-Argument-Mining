OH1wqdihyO NON-ARG 757 767 Yes, sure.
XLbxllUP-9 NON-ARG 770 803 ll take the advertising question.
_N5QYC3n2M CLAIM-Fact 854 999 But what our goals there are to be helpful to customers and enhance their shopping and viewing experiences, mostly with targeted recommendations.
sGxyRqItp0 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1000 1105 We think that is a good strategy rather than invasive things that take away from the shopping experience.
EWTgXB2m1u CLAIM-Fact 1106 1161 I would say Sponsored Products is off to a great start.
gE73JA7fzQ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1162 1239 I find it a very effective way for advertisers to reach interested customers.
xiWNo7NICp NON-ARG 804 853 So yes, it's very early in the advertising space.
hATCdPY_Nl NON-ARG 1240 1309 We also, on video, have not added much in the way of advertising yet.
SJZIyHaiip NON-ARG 1310 1346 There's some pre-roll as we call it.
iS6gIoDYK9 NON-ARG 1347 1394 But for the most part, we like the progression.

ISVP1nF1gx NON-ARG 1626 1758 These things include revenue from our co-branded credit card arrangements and certain advertising, particularly display advertising.
VLT-py6vV1 NON-ARG 1759 2059 We have other types of advertising that's spread out throughout the P&L, whether that's a kind of shared marketing investment from our vendors which goes into contra COGS and lowers the cost of sales, or it's related to other seller advertising which is generally within the EGM and media categories.
jczaBlphMt NON-ARG 2060 2143 And so I'd say other revenue incorporates a number of things, not just advertising.
dApfkLZiBn NON-ARG 2144 2218 And on India demonetization, nothing particular to call out today on that.
GS4Cs4hsks NON-ARG 1395 1504 We are balancing customer experience with advertising at all times and we like the team that's working on it.
