YzFAjLdhtj CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1036 1174 And that we think if we do a great job with the product that people will be willing to spend more because they get so much more out of it.
z1ngwQ54O2 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1175 1252 And I think you can look at the results on the iPhone and see that in action.
XKeDWPeocR NON-ARG 801 816 Toni, it's Tim.
DRtFOIulHK NON-ARG 817 861 We look at it a bit differently than you do.
fxOXCXBdGj NON-ARG 862 1035 We look at it as our job is to grow our products regardless of the price, which means that we need to convince in some cases people to move from one price band to the other.
-7RUsRZPlh PREMISE-Other 1344 1448 These numbers are unbelievable and they're done in an environment where it's not the best of conditions.
rQXLnLMyPz NON-ARG 1449 1474 So that's how we look at.
WViHRQlcXb NON-ARG 1475 1600 We don't do the MBA analysis of there's only X people buying in a price band and therefore we can only get X minus Y percent.
FVAvSNeyfn NON-ARG 1601 1644 That's not the way we've ever looked at it.

aA5vAxVhvo CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2497 2606 But I think the answer is that both of those things are happening and it's key that we do both, not just one.
HwNvkVjX1o PREMISE-Fact 2280 2371 I think there's no doubt if you look at it we are expanding the market size in those areas.
mkd8v5Sh9L PREMISE-Fact 2372 2496 It's also true that there's some people that are switching from comparable price points to the iPhone, and that's great too.
jSMummUyxy PREMISE-Hypothesis 3516 3557 Our own data would look better than that.
lxH-DgZ1mD CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3426 3515 The 86% also seems low to me but I was quoting a third-party source and not our own data.
SE_TEba06q CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3962 4043 And I think it'll be interesting to see how that plays out over the next horizon.
E3LU1r44Ei CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4044 4129 But generally speaking, I see positive vectors there, not negative, in the aggregate.
