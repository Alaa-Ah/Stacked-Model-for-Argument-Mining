a4DyxK0ACO PREMISE-Fact 1015 1097 In terms of the election, it’s important to note that we’re large and diversified,
kBJdvIZ3Qo CLAIM-Fact 1098 1137 so no one vertical drives our business.
2bzhqVg7JX NON-ARG 1138 1279 Yes, the 2016 election is a big deal in terms of ad spend but so is the World Cup, so Super Bowl every year, so are events like the Olympics.
uiwUn9d6Lm CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1356 1426 We believe we have position that doesn’t exist on any other platforms.
QElRDG5oBE PREMISE-Fact 1427 1605 So for example, using Facebook and Instagram ads you can target by congressional district, you can target by interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those.
KLm-G0j-P4 NON-ARG 1280 1355 We are excited about the targeting we’re able to offer for our ad platform.
LCz1kVk6mm CLAIM-Fact 1606 1688 And we’re seeing politicians at all level really take advantage of that targeting.
Vgmhb47cMG NON-ARG 1689 1813 It’s also probably worth saying that we’re pretty excited about what’s happening with the elections organically on Facebook.
UxT0H4Oj_h CLAIM-Fact 1814 1851 Facebook is really the new town hall.
uPFKozOgqL PREMISE-RealExample 1995 2060 Every member of Congress in the United States is now on Facebook.
6yYNenu2yZ PREMISE-Fact 2061 2139 We’re seeing some of them post every vote and explain why they’re doing votes.
6-bBKTRzKy PREMISE-Fact 2140 2288 We’re seeing a bunch of that candidates for president get on Facebook themselves and interact taking questions from their potential voters directly.
l-xU-UroXO NON-ARG 1852 1994 And connecting the people who are running for office, both at the national and the local level with people directly has been really important.
4LRkRQu2SI NON-ARG 2289 2559 And we think that kind of direct engagement where people can hold their elected officials accountable and elected officials can speak directly to constituents is a really important part of our mission and we’re excited about the 2016 election and what’s happening there.
xm-XUwCoMP NON-ARG 2577 2609 Well, I’ll answer the other one.
moxXxpxeEX NON-ARG 2610 2673 In terms of the story that you said, I think you have it wrong.
CZcOJHIgYV NON-ARG 2674 2842 I don’t know where you got that story from, I’ve never had a conversation with the team where we were behind on mobile and then I said we need to do this to make money.
AbIgpMZMXx NON-ARG 2843 2876 That’s not really how we operate.
viEbaZHUkJ PREMISE-Fact 2877 3066 What happened is we realized that mobile was growing faster than desktop and that people were shifting their usage and that it was the more important thing for people’s consumer experience.
8F8S1eEdv8 CLAIM-Fact 3067 3159 And that’s when we made the shift, not in our business first but in how we develop products.
srqjvcVuiS NON-ARG 3160 3256 And I told all of our product team and when they come in reviews really just coming with mobile.
uBBznIHIFC NON-ARG 3257 3396 If you come in and you try to show me a desktop product, then I am going to kick you out; you have to come in and show me a mobile product.
-rkvAuS02R NON-ARG 3397 3560 And that I think was just as a crude leadership tactic, somewhat effective and helping to motivate the organization to shift its energy towards focusing on mobile.
F82iMf5-e7 PREMISE-Fact 3760 3846 And we actually prioritized making the mobile experience good before putting ad there.
DU0KuxtM7k CLAIM-Fact 3847 3931 So there was a long time where people thought that our business might not be as good
6eHgKsT7f0 PREMISE-Fact 3932 4098 because we had no ads on mobile, and that was because we always prioritized the experience for people above, even if it’s going to be a painful thing for the company.
3E4svuBaJ3 NON-ARG 4099 4137 So that’s how I think about messaging.
FJqb5phTXx CLAIM-Fact 4138 4199 We know that messaging is going to be increasingly important,
IGPL1vURW2 PREMISE-RealExample 4200 4385 that’s why we went out and hired David Marcus who is one of the best product leaders in the field to Messenger and why we bought WhatsApp, which the leading messaging product worldwide.
kIv81B5AZ_ CLAIM-Fact 4386 4442 And we have a formula for how we build these businesses.
s4EXIJaMs5 PREMISE-Fact 4443 4549 First, you build a great consumer experience that helps people share in a new way that’s really important.
0LbskwbZMw CLAIM-Fact 4902 5083 And then only once you have that ramped up to a good scale, can you really start dialing up advertising having that feel good and be a good part of your experience with good content
VY8JsIqkJB PREMISE-Fact 5084 5183 because all those public figures and businesses are already participating in the platform at scale.
TqTgMh7U1H NON-ARG 5184 5311 So, you could expect to see that playbook in Instagram, we’re pretty far along in terms of having quite a mature pubic content.
imY5ZRQAul CLAIM-Fact 5312 5373 Ecosystem and ads are ramping well with good high quality ads
a7a4HjkpO6 PREMISE-Fact 5374 5504 because a lot of public figures and businesses are already investing in creating that kind of good content that goes in Instagram.
WJmxdajIGR NON-ARG 5505 5573 And you’re going to see the same playbook in Messenger and WhatsApp.
jWhENMuFkR NON-ARG 5574 5799 In terms of making it so there are organic businesses and public figures, there is a bit more of that on WhatsApp already in terms of businesses using it and our Messenger, we are catching on Messenger; we’ll do that on both.
XpChPMOTvP NON-ARG 5800 5882 And once we have those ecosystems built out, we will build businesses around them.
CMDiRHAABs NON-ARG 5883 6010 And that’s how we think about stuff and we’ll do that in all of our products and the different things that we do going forward.
LVYB9hVavF NON-ARG 4550 4901 Then after that you can start to introduce organic ways that people can interact with businesses, so that in Facebook is pages, the businesses that people want to interact with, the public figures, the politicians, not necessary ads but organic interactions around not necessarily just your friends and families but more public figures and businesses.
5dzG6SOSvk NON-ARG 3561 3759 But if you remember, we actually went through a pretty tough period because we went through this period where our mobile experience was not as good as we wanted it to be and we had no ads on mobile.
XcivdNSpgg NON-ARG 6028 6088  Operator, it looks like we have time for one last question.
