L1GB7MuZfL NON-ARG 651 664 Thanks Keith.
kWdB7Uf39p NON-ARG 665 735 Let me start with the cloud and then I’ll move to your phone question.
qaBS6CYG1z CLAIM-Opinion(view) 736 956 Overall in the commercial business, I think we continue to see gross margin improvement and that is sustainable improvement as opposed to I think what you characterized as some non-recurring things that I have mentioned.
NFHaBlmVSM PREMISE-Fact 957 1125 It continues to be improvements in scale, improvements in our infrastructure, improvements in utilization, really strong work across all of our engineering teams here. 
AAAZ9y8SNu CLAIM-Reformulated 1125 1355 And so I think our year-over-year improvement as well as sequential improvement and our ability in the overall commercial business, you see the gross margins we did has the mix shift to the cloud, I think we’re all quite proud of.
ZwGgVxXflK NON-ARG 1356 1461 Onto the phone business where I did call out non-recurring items due to the business integration expense.
PbWhy7VVgM PREMISE-Fact 1566 1680 Q4 was a little depressed is how as we think about it due to some of the restructuring; Q1 is a little bit higher.
SlZq2ec8uY PREMISE-Fact 1681 1774 A more blended rate of those two is probably a better way to think about a go-forward margin.
FhJhDmj7y3 PREMISE-Fact 2032 2412 Just to add one thing that I’d say is sort of -- to Mark’s question, which is in particular on Azure, we have some commodity workloads but we also have many differentiated higher margin workloads especially in the Enterprise Mobility Suite is what I’d call out is a good example of an infrastructure workload completely in the cloud that has got a very different margin structure.
nft9yZyTzo CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1462 1565 I don’t -- easier way frankly to think about that Keith is our Q4 gross margin and our Q1 gross margin.
1tmo-hA6zp CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1775 1953 Although when you’re transitioning any business and all the hard work that we’re doing here to prepare ourselves going forward, I do expect to see some volatility in that number.
qa2VwpVFaa CLAIM-Fact 2413 2522 And those are the things that really give us the ability to have good margin structure for our cloud efforts.
