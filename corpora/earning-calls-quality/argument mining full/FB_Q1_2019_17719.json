So one of the things we learned is that consumers usually move to new features, to new products, to new places before marketers, and it\u2019s really up to us to help marketers move there quickly. We definitely saw that with mobile, that one of the barriers was convincing marketers that they needed to be with mobile. But then there was a second barrier which was just making it easier for them to do it. If you take your long TV ad or your 30-second TV spot and you just put it on mobile, it doesn\u2019t perform as well as a mobile first ad, and that\u2019s been something we\u2019ve worked on. Now, we\u2019re really applying that lesson to Stories. First, we need to convince marketers that people are using Stories, and I think having seen the mobile shift, their process \u2013 they\u2019re getting that I think more quickly. But then we have to make it easy. So if you look at some of the tools and products I\u2019ve talked about in the last couple of quarters, now you can \u2013 rather than us saying to you, go make a Stories ad you can just send us some pictures, some text, some very easy posts and we will create some Stories ads for you. So our process is, we have one sales team selling all of these products; I think that helps us a lot because they already have those relationships. And we\u2019re doing all we can to make it very easy to adopt the format. We also want to make this as automated as possible. So the long run view should be that you can give us maybe simple pictures, maybe simple videos, maybe an ad you\u2019ve produced, and we can do the placement for you, because we think over time our systems will do a better job deciding where your ads should be placed and even helping you target until you\u2019re seeing us build tools in that direction as well. In terms of how much of its incremental, I\u2019m sure not all of it is. There\u2019s \u2013 definitely has to be some cannibalization for people who are doing feed ads as they get Stories. But we\u2019ve seen that over time as we move people we\u2019re able to get increasing shares, hopefully, of their budget but it\u2019s our job to earn that.

But on the demand side, want to specifically call out several factors that are contributing to ad targeting headwinds. The first is just the evolution of the regulatory landscape, and here I would point to regulations like GDPR. The number of people who have opted out on using context from the apps and websites they visit for ad targeting has continued to increase since the adoption of GDPR, so we\u2019ve seen that come up both in Europe and around the world.
