So I can talk to the multi-app question first. So we view the social space as almost this matrix. You can think about it as a two-dimensional grid where one axis is the richness of the content that people want to share, then other axis is the size of the audience, or intimacy of how people want to share. So on the first axis, you get everything ranging from text to links, to photos, to videos, to immersive 360 videos and virtual reality content and this progression. And on the other axis, you get everything ranging from one-to-one messaging to small group communication, to communicating with all your friends at once, to big interest groups, to completely public. And what we believe is that you can intersect at any point on that. And there will be something interesting to build. So a small group product for sharing video, that's going to be a thing. A one-on-one product for sharing text or calling, that's clearly a thing. A public sharing and consumption product for video, that's a thing. And what we've tried to do is basically figure out the areas that we think are open and are not currently served by the set of products that the industry has built and figure out a way to offer those. So one of the big opportunities that I'm really excited about right now is I think that there's a pretty big opening between very private messaging, the one-on-one messaging products like Messenger and WhatsApp, and products like Facebook where you share with all your friends at once or Instagram. And in between there, what we're seeing is this huge growth of private groups, right, and Groups remains one of the I think least talked about products on Facebook. But I just said earlier that we have more than 900 million people are using that every month. It's a huge thing and it's a big area that we can develop going forward. So we experiment with all these things in terms of some of them make sense to naturally have inside the Facebook app because you're using the same set of friends and network and connections. Some of them get clear value by being separate, like Messenger, for example, where we can make sure that everyone has their push notifications turned on, which is extremely important for a messaging app. But overall, there's a lot of stuff in the space. And the amount that people want to share and communicate is boundless and that's I think partially why we're seeing the growth that we are with so many of these products.", "start": 817, "labels": ["ANSWER"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 3293, "text": "Sheryl K.
