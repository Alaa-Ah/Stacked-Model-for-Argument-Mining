p_91AeaKJX NON-ARG 1064 1112 I'll start and then I'll transition to you, Amy.
Ej84D8PxUn CLAIM-Fact 1113 1183 I don't view it that narrowly quarter to quarter or even year to year.
FP13kJ5JVL CLAIM-Fact 1184 1321 These are generational opportunities that what's at play when it comes to the Intelligent Cloud or what's happening in augmented reality.
xDTANT4xaI PREMISE-Fact 1322 1451 Either one of those things, I think if we started viewing it quarter to quarter or year to year, we'll completely miss the trend.
QXD57nSBCy PREMISE-Fact 1452 1592 We definitely need to be smart about two things that Amy said before, which is pick markets that are secular growth markets and got big TAM.
NjI-6D5J9f PREMISE-Fact 1593 1637 And most importantly, what's our role in it?
FvU6Pzwmr_ PREMISE-Fact 1777 1922 The fact that we put some salespeople and then there's increased productivity is something that we obviously celebrate and we track very closely.
9AmHNk8YQ4 PREMISE-Fact 1923 2107 But the places where we are more likely to go and put our OpEx in the coming quarters, in the coming years are going to be about revenue that's going to show up for multiple years out.
hyxzWgFfcF PREMISE-Fact 2108 2170 And it won't be very transparent to you, and that's how it is.
ct4U2z4ge4 PREMISE-Fact 2171 2317 If we had not gotten started on some of the distributed computing infrastructure in a completely different place, we wouldn't have even had Azure.
V1AW2-BImW PREMISE-Fact 2318 2409 But I completely understand that all of you measure us to what we have done for you lately.
u5pKr54bQb PREMISE-Fact 2410 2490 And that's a fine way and we'll keep account of it, but that's not how it works.
6xRoZCEZ2H CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2504 2740 I think the important part in what Satya says is the distinction between really engineering investments that take multiple years of investment and world view on a TAM and holding ourselves accountable to sales and marketing investments.
ZHmCksjIf1 PREMISE-Fact 2741 2779 And are they earning the right return?
aSf2GVkCgV PREMISE-Fact 2780 2815 Are we doing them in the right way?

RZ2PFVNGo7 PREMISE-Fact 2846 2919 Are we investing in the right types of people, in the right capabilities?
dht3EJXeOh PREMISE-Fact 2920 3109 What I look and say that this number shows is that we are doing and it is encouraging that the plan that we put in place, that the sales team has done a really terrific job of executing on.
zqtLHe07Tx PREMISE-Fact 3110 3289 And all that does is build more confidence that both we've picked a good market and we're investing in the right type of people to make sure we land that opportunity at customers.
F0MfaxqPPv PREMISE-Fact 3290 3418 And then the most important thing is that the customers' success is what will breed revenue for the next quarter, the next year.
gnPZ8l99Bz PREMISE-Fact 3419 3580 And especially in this market, a generational move here really means, especially for many of the workloads being moved, these pay off every year for the next 10.

07iUa7Dlq2 PREMISE-Fact 1732 1776 That's where we spend most of our cycles in.
