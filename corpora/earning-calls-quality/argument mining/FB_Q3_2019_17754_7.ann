KHR-XCA2xO NON-ARG 678 714 Dave, do that and then I'll wrap on,
eFJpBNHIcI NON-ARG 728 732 Yes.
TISbJgOZHo NON-ARG 733 749 Thanks, Michael.
Ct5WT_DWoC CLAIM-Fact 750 782 No plans to bring that in-house.
WCmTEndVjr CLAIM-Fact 783 872 We obviously have a lot of people in-house who work with the third-parties on that front.
jjWVNwdfJZ CLAIM-Fact 873 956 But we have a wide variety of different partners beyond Cognizant who work with us.
tp13ymKV9b CLAIM-Reformulated 957 1010 So there is no change in model planned on that front.
lOoLsXyvEd CLAIM-Other 1011 1129 But we continue to obviously invest heavily in that work and we'll continue to work with other partners in that space.
qAZgDHNRbS NON-ARG 1417 1490 So I'll talk a bit about both of them and why I think they are important.
hjmcn4HQIN NON-ARG 1147 1225 All right, so on news, there are two things that I'm quite excited about here.
kS6v9_MW6X CLAIM-Fact 1226 1295 One is just building a dedicated product space for high quality news.
r7Bl67pxwa CLAIM-Fact 1296 1416 And the second is having a business partnership with news publishers that I think can be sustainable over the long term.
C8w8y9_zCE NON-ARG 1491 1728 We'll start with the product, which is if you look at the Facebook app overall, for a lot of years the app was synonymous with News Feed, right, the main tab in the app and of course everyone who uses Facebook pretty much uses News Feed.
hvBi2L2vlZ NON-ARG 1729 1998 And one of the questions that we had was, there are of course a lot of things that some people want to do, but not everyone and we weren't sure if we were going to be able to build a secondary tab in the app that could be meaningful even if most people didn't use them.
kuj8OfsWIz PREMISE-Fact 1999 2183 But we started building things like Marketplace, that is a tab that and even if the majority of people on Facebook don't use it, it's still hundreds of millions of people are using it.
Xmdab0T0AO PREMISE-Fact 2226 2245 And we built Watch.
RlmnATjNr4 CLAIM-Fact 2246 2281 We're seeing a similar trend there.
0VOPyGED4A PREMISE-Fact 2282 2454 It took us a little while to really get it to work the way that we wanted, but now it's growing quickly, that's going to be hundreds of millions of people who are using it.
C4KrCY0h4D PREMISE-Fact 2455 2485 We rolled out Facebook Dating.
zz3xUtOPid CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2486 2703 I don't know if that will be many hundreds of millions of people just because of the size of that market, but it's going be very useful for tens of millions of people around the world, maybe a hundred million or more.
1XfuM0ewJN PREMISE-Fact 3577 3793 And surely even though not everyone comes to Facebook, because they want high quality news , I believe that there are going to be, whether it's 10% or 20% at a floor who I think would really want something like this.
MKwAdmcBoY CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3794 3912 And, we're going to work with the news publishers to make this very valuable and I'm optimistic that we can get there.
frUXFCc-Jb NON-ARG 3913 3977 So that's the kind of the product strategy on the Facebook side.
iUlpDN2Q9B CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3978 4150 Produce publishers, the thing that I'm excited about is, look, I do think that we have a responsibility to help work with newest publishers to fund high quality journalism.
ByMnnwtl0V PREMISE-Fact 4151 4232 It's no secret that the Internet has disrupted the business model for journalism.
oBmhOwNSJ8 CLAIM-Reformulated 4233 4365 And I think that that means that the major Internet platforms have a responsibility to form partnerships and help to fund this work.
ndd6Owjv5q NON-ARG 4366 4412 And the challenge that we've had historically.
bbhJtSQWpx NON-ARG 4413 4471 Is that when most of the usage of the Act was a News Feed.
QOG2BW-6K- NON-ARG 5541 5558 Great, thank you.
QQJCaM-2Kj NON-ARG 5559 5594 Thank you all for joining us today.
xmlW7cWWgF NON-ARG 5595 5666 We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you again.
_3rpw6omwe CLAIM-Fact 2184 2225 So that's really, that's really valuable.
J6uoghKj6- CLAIM-Other 2704 2828 And we are of course doing this with groups and there will be opportunities to do this in other places, including with news.
7jDxEsUhcR PREMISE-Hypothesis 2829 3256 So I think in the future if this works out, what we're going to see is that how people use the Facebook app is going to be, they're going to keep on using News Feed, they are going to keep on sharing with friends and family, but the average person will also probably have one, two or three other apps or kind of secondary tabs that they use that are quite useful for them in connecting with their broader community on Facebook.
AO-OINGA1_ CLAIM-Fact 3257 3344 But those things that each individual use, they're going to vary from person to person.
BhJgLugibp PREMISE-Fact 3345 3576 So it's not going to be that everyone is using News Feed, they're going to have -- different people are going to care about different things, whether it's community, or marketplace marketplace for some or dating or news for others.
lm6B6zWuqt NON-ARG 4472 4591 What our community told us is that they really wanted more content from friends and family and less other stuff, right.
1vW9q5xjdq NON-ARG 4592 4665 So less public video is less of other content besides friends and family.
JZ5RORrBnn NON-ARG 4666 4848 So even though we were talking to a lot of news publishers and we wanted to find a way to support and they of course wanted more distribution and some kind of financial relationship.
f0u3oFeA19 NON-ARG 4849 5023 It didn't really make a lot of sense in the past to pay for content to that a lot of our community was generally telling us that they want to see other stuff instead of that.
NVqzOG2M0D NON-ARG 5024 5060 But now with the dedicated news tab.
VQltkM2pkM NON-ARG 5352 5376 And I think in doing so.
T6qXmS8KCm PREMISE-Fact 5377 5490 This can be a long-term virtuous cycle and sustainable business model in way that we can help support journalism.
1DIj5oUyNs CLAIM-Opinion(view) 5491 5523 And I'm really happy to do this.
aTYBVWFNJ_ NON-ARG 5323 5351 It makes it a great product.
b-JLlcw9cI CLAIM-Fact 5061 5322 We finally have a space where the business model forward really works for us to be in a long-term sustainable financial relationship with news publishers, where we can pay them for high quality content that can go in there that will be what would fuels the tab.
