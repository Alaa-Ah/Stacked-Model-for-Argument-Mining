scN2mMt-yO NON-ARG 783 794 Hey, Brian.
V23H64n-F9 NON-ARG 795 805 It's Dave.
gkgE7Ykr57 CLAIM-Fact 806 987 In terms of what we're seeing as opportunities, I mean, we continue to see good growth opportunities for revenue across both Facebook and Instagram, including both feed and Stories.
8HbiLlGOmJ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 988 1172 I think in terms of impression growth, you're going to have more opportunities in Stories, probably more opportunity on Instagram, but good revenue growth opportunities in both places.
YHfbAu51d0 CLAIM-Reformulated 1173 1237 So that's obviously what we're looking for when we look forward.
haR81QQrrM NON-ARG 1238 1328 Beyond that, I don't have much to update on in terms of any more specific revenue outlook.
Rjs-gmJCi4 CLAIM-Policy 1353 1573 And to the video questions, the biggest thing that we need to do is make sure that the video experience is people-centric and that we're helping creators build community and we're helping people interact with each other.
ikB4I_gdt4 NON-ARG 1574 1677 Our journey with video has been a little bit funny, in that people really want to watch a lot of video.
uPdJS3uEkv NON-ARG 1678 1786 And to a large degree, we've had to limit its growth and we had to do the things so we can stop limiting it.
nA1TxBo1aG NON-ARG 1787 2009 The things that have caused us to limit it are, on the one hand, when we see passive consumption of video displacing social interactions, that's not something that we've wanted because we feel like that's what Facebook is.
FgwVvXDoaV CLAIM-Reformulated 2288 2447 So we needed to figure out a way so that video can grow, but people can also keep on interacting doing what they tell us that they uniquely want from Facebook.
z2sNng0NN4 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2617 2837 And I think that's a very exciting opportunity ahead, and that's one of the reasons that I'm very optimistic about the Watch growth that we've started to see recently up about 3x in the last few months in the U.S. alone.
eCL_mxAwuy NON-ARG 2010 2061 We build social products that help people interact.
9xt2XzT6KH NON-ARG 2062 2287 There are lots of places in the world that you can go to consume content, but we're the Internet service that people use to help connect with other people and we're not going to let passive consumption get in the way of that.
xvm9v-v-2r CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2448 2616 And now, I think we're starting to work through what the formula is going to be so we can take some of those rate limits off and let video grow at the rate it wants to.
