YcIEVqlKam NON-ARG 610 615 Sure.
sHldrFypwv NON-ARG 616 711 So I'll talk about sharing, and then I think Dave can probably talk about ad loads and pricing.
GoCnDA03ID CLAIM-Fact 712 763 So, the overall level of sharing is up on Facebook.
AvoINmemmg NON-ARG 764 864 And what we're seeing is that how people share is evolving as we move from desktop to mobile, right.
b-FCn7Iux8 NON-ARG 865 1032 So you can imagine more photos on people's mobile cameras, fewer long full photo albums, more ability to capture video, probably a little bit harder to type on mobile.
PqiR9_9MDa NON-ARG 1033 1059 So there's this evolution.
95dA3q64q3 NON-ARG 1060 1150 The other thing that we see is that now people have tools to share more privately as well.
erXoYdexsU NON-ARG 1151 1280 So when you think about sharing on Facebook, you shouldn't just think about the kind of sharing that you see in News Feed, right.
dNFjyI34oF NON-ARG 1281 1419 So sharing with all of your friends, sharing in groups on Facebook and public sharing, which are the trends that I was just talking about.
IYWUAEF_XH PREMISE-Statistic 1420 1671 But another area that's growing incredibly quickly is private messaging, right, where between Messenger and WhatsApp, I think we're around 60 billion messages a day, which I think is something like three times more than the peak of global SMS traffic.
Tbn6VXcoL4 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1672 1767 So that is something that's growing pretty quickly and that we're really excited about as well.
6161p4HVDL NON-ARG 1768 2046 And we're just going to continue working on giving people the best tools across the spectrum from private to public, and across the spectrum from text-based and simple communication to richer type of media like photos, videos, and then, eventually, more immersive forms like VR.
Ew3r89ZHgx PREMISE-Fact 2064 2209 Yeah, and Justin, in terms of ad load, we've talked about the different factors that go into it, obviously, just in driving the overall business.
ljeLBogTqs NON-ARG 2210 2313 Advertiser demand, that was particularly strong this period, and then also we matched that with supply.
BkcVKefmYa NON-ARG 2314 2392 And the supply â€“ the two big drivers are user and time spent and then ad load.
tbjvGqFqqe NON-ARG 2393 2503 And getting the balance and mix right is important, and clearly, how the pricing plays out is via the auction.
cUHeH8A6Dz PREMISE-Fact 2504 2679 And we've had a good balance of demand growth and supply growth, and that's led to our good strong financial results and our ability to deliver very strong ROI to advertisers.
0xKIROiQBm CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2680 2795 So we think we're in a good zone on the right ad load, and we do think there's opportunities to grow that modestly.
rDlFjomLfp NON-ARG 2796 2899 But as we look forward into 2017, we think it'll be a less significant factor driving inventory growth.
Pd95ElnnR8 NON-ARG 2900 2995 But we still think there's opportunities to drive inventory through user growth and time spent.
ivfEflHqZW NON-ARG 2996 3077 I don't think we would think about necessarily dropping ad load to drive pricing.
jAzaes8Pg7 NON-ARG 3078 3302 We're also very cognizant of providing good value to advertisers, and getting that balance right is important to driving overall ROI, as well as obviously providing better targeting and measurement tools for our advertisers.
