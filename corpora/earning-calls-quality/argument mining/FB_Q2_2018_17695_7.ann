boLIgI8yRg NON-ARG 910 923 Sure, Collin.
Q1t3Y5Fhmh NON-ARG 924 952 Let me take a crack at that.
X-uIrfyLfA NON-ARG 953 1003 So, in terms of the guidance, I've given guidance.
zWtJmvQCl9 CLAIM-Fact 1004 1063 This is several years, so more than two but less than many.
_YEhwZeH3E CLAIM-Reformulated 1064 1128 So it's over a timeframe more than two years is our expectation.
i-rAX4nr4r NON-ARG 1948 1958 All right.
LAFEhdOqix NON-ARG 1959 2012 And I can take the question on the midterm elections.
5XjZqC7Wqz CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2013 2262 So, yes, the short answer is that we're much more confident that we're going to get this right for the elections in the 2018, which include the U.S. midterms, but also the elections in Brazil and upcoming elections in early-2019 in India and the EU.
yAKAoZ5nhw PREMISE-RealExample 2263 2564 And the reason why we're confident that we can get this right is because there have been several elections since the 2016 ones that have had much better results, including the French presidential election, the German elections, the Alabama special election, and the Mexican election about a month ago.
SUYxamP5GY PREMISE-RealExample 2565 2843 And in each of these – going back to 2016, we were – we have a very big security team that was focused on security around even the 2016 election and we found hacking and phishing attacks that the Russian government was trying to do, and we notified the right people about those.
f9a7qN-7kt CLAIM-Fact 2939 3106 And since then, we've built the playbook out that has included building AI tools to identify thousands of fake accounts and groups and pages that violate the policies.
_ZvYqzb5aa PREMISE-Statistic 3107 3243 It's included growing the security and content review teams to 20,000 people to be able to handle the volume of work that we need to do.
L0LK2K63El PREMISE-Fact 3244 3443 And it includes a lot of the transparency work around advertising in general, but also the political and issue ads archive and verifying all advertisers who are trying to run political and issue ads.
dQb_GZF0jM NON-ARG 3665 3713 And that will have a longer-term impact as well.
DO78eC6L_J CLAIM-Fact 3776 3795 2018 is a big year.
LUiM2s1Gdi PREMISE-Fact 3796 3976 And because of the successful results that we've seen in a number of elections recently, we feel like our road map and our level of preparation is much higher now than it has been.
iMibQWwaXN CLAIM-Reformulated 3977 4037 And we feel relatively confident going into these elections.
B6TUc5IZsK NON-ARG 2844 2938 But 2016 was really the first time that we saw this kind of coordinated information operation.
Hx_fKOpvlE PREMISE-Fact 3444 3664 There are a number of other things that we're doing too, including creating an external program for independent academics to study how the impact of social media and how foreign governments try to interfere in elections.
At7WS4dHcW NON-ARG 3714 3775 But the short answer here is we've been very focused on this.
T6AufHYNpf CLAIM-Fact 1129 1277 And then in terms of does that have any meaningful contribution from areas of innovation, we talked about some of the areas that we're investing in.
eP8sTvs-zy PREMISE-Fact 1278 1460 Obviously, on the safety and security side, those are costs that are layering in that we think are the right thing to do for the business but don't necessarily have a revenue impact.
pLUMnbmyOr PREMISE-Fact 1461 1502 So it certainly takes those into account.
PkpFhGXtlt PREMISE-Fact 1503 1726 It also takes into account the ongoing investments we're making in the longer-term innovation work, which I don't think will necessarily have any meaningful revenue relative to the size of the business in those time frames.
gDDP4_O7e6 PREMISE-Fact 1727 1923 We're also investing in things like video, Watch and the like, which have the potential to condition tribute on the revenue side, but still relatively small in perspective of the overall business.
IIcjtqeQny NON-ARG 4055 4062  Great.
