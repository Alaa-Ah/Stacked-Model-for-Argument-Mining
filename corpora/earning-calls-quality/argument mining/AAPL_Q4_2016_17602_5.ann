rmPnxHDDmG NON-ARG 3415 3555 We are open to acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value where we can deliver better products to our customers and innovate more.
YfYhFWnsLI NON-ARG 3556 3664 And so we look at a whole variety of companies, and based on that, we choose whether to move forward or not.
KAuGhcGzPY NON-ARG 3665 3714 But we're definitely open and we definitely look.
7P71BMI8e- NON-ARG 407 443 Yeah, it's a good question, Shannon.
JxU8GLXE3- NON-ARG 444 643 So to sort of back up from our results for the quarter, the 90-day clock, and look at the full year of 2016, we were down 17% compared to the fiscal year 2015 which was up 84% from the previous year.
8dtimRlqB6 NON-ARG 644 756 So if you look at 2014 to 2016, the revenue grew 52% and the CAGR was 23%, which is really a pretty good result.
y9_EyOQa88 NON-ARG 942 966 And so, why was it down?
8dfnJgH-D0 PREMISE-Fact 967 1266 There's lots of reasons, but the largest one in our view is that when you look at what happened in 2015 in China, we had a surge of upgraders that came into the market for the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, and the upgrade rate increased relatively more in Greater China than elsewhere around the world.
IE5gvHR8zk CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1447 1515 And so that's the main reason in our view that you see a difference.
05Eek8uDHF PREMISE-Fact 1267 1446 And so when that upgrade rate in fiscal year 2016 returned to a more normal upgrade rate, which would be akin to what we saw with the iPhone 5S as a point, it had further to fall.
i64a_q0JEf NON-ARG 1516 1606 Now that spun or created another issue for us, because we didn't forecast that accurately.
7lWMHW51gi PREMISE-Fact 1607 1771 So in Q1 of last year, we put in too much channel inventory and had been resetting the channel inventory over the few quarters that came beyond it or came after it.
iKS6Mgh3un PREMISE-Fact 2005 2095 It's very hard to gauge demand, as you know, when you're selling everything you're making.
yR-CbIQeoz CLAIM-Fact 1920 2004 Now looking forward, the response to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has been very positive.
FGGajEVr8c CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2096 2281 And so we'll find out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough to give you guys guidance that we're returning to growth this quarter, which obviously feels very good for us.
FEw45YtMjQ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2282 2388 And from a longer-term point of view, out of the 90-day clocks and so forth, we are very bullish on China.
POkJdh7xXU PREMISE-Fact 2389 2445 We continue to see a middle class that is booming there.
0hWjQ_5bru PREMISE-Fact 2446 2554 There might be some sort of a new normal in the economy, but a new normal there is still a good growth rate.
70p445Z8pb PREMISE-Statistic 2555 2771 And so with the number of middle class â€“ people growing into the middle class and the LTE adoption rate being still fairly low, around 45%, 50% or so, then I think we continue to have a really good opportunity there,
eQBHuNC4CQ CLAIM-Reformulated 2772 2823 and so we continue to focus significantly in China.
yMNMDK2e8F CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1772 1919 And so those two issues, which really the main one is really the first one and the second one was a symptom of it, are in our views the main issue.
xrACLQpJhh NON-ARG 757 941 Also as you probably know, the fiscal year 2016 performance was hurt by the devaluation of the currency which affected it about 3%, so the underlying business performance was 14% down.
cfwcLiEvGe NON-ARG 64 85  Thank you very much.
IYjdRIYNwk NON-ARG 86 108 A couple of questions.
KGeISTOMeO NON-ARG 109 226 The first, Tim, can you talk a bit more about China, just how you're thinking about it, where you're seeing pressure?
EPHdWDReYG NON-ARG 227 385 I know you mentioned that you expect to see a significant rebound during the first quarter, but what are your customers telling you about the demand in China?
dpipBtKFUO NON-ARG 2841 2848  Great.
AFqKPGlFmc NON-ARG 2849 2859 Thank you.
aKjEujVIgm NON-ARG 2880 2885  Yes.
BWNyyuAPZJ NON-ARG 2903 2951  And then can you talk a bit about acquisitions?
CyKDyRHwyZ NON-ARG 2952 3128 And I don't mean like the smaller ones that you've done sort of at a normal cadence, but there was clearly a fairly large one announced at least this week in the content world.
ysgdEqrQpz NON-ARG 3129 3259 And especially if you find a way to have repatriation of some of the cash at a low tax rate possibly with the next administration.
meXNbnABKk NON-ARG 3260 3393 So I just, if you can give sort of an overall view of how you think about acquisitions that might be a little bit larger than normal.
lxugaaOIIQ NON-ARG 3732 3743  Thank you.
engTDRHoCA NON-ARG 3764 3769  Yes.
