lurrAaCPqq NON-ARG 2555 2569 Is it revenue?
yFzjGnWycE NON-ARG 2570 2660 I was making a revenue statement but units are also, yes we expect units to be up as well.
kKooCKxlyX NON-ARG 2155 2186 I don’t know that we will exit.
kbCjwhLNXC NON-ARG 2187 2368 We make that call late in the quarter as we see what the demand is because we are actually trying to position the inventory for the following quarter instead of the current quarter.
sYvRolhvqy NON-ARG 2369 2404 And it’s very difficult to predict.
DkWXzAysYv NON-ARG 2405 2434 What was your other question?
CkFtRuvDyD CLAIM-Fact 1250 1433 We have a very good track record overtime to reduce those cost structures, but every time we introduce a new product that is a headwind at the beginning of the cycle for gross margin.
zNewqzwQdN PREMISE-Fact 1017 1102 We are launching some now and everything we launch new products, we make them better.
v68hQRPcLk PREMISE-Fact 1103 1249 We had features and new technology and these products when we launch and tend to have higher cost structures than the products what they replaced.
BIQmAtDPgJ NON-ARG 541 545 Yes.
GxYXEwtvhE NON-ARG 546 614 Let me give you puts and takes for margins for the December quarter.
aQVcVaZkVB NON-ARG 615 734 On the positive side, of course as you mentioned that we would have positive leverage from the higher seasonal volumes.
sYZBHzJlxE NON-ARG 735 909 Also what we've seen over the last several quarters is a commodity environment that has been quite favorable and we expect it to remain favorable during the December quarter.
TYTnVUudav NON-ARG 910 978 On the other hand, of course we are launching a lot of new products.
QfCDOGczyB NON-ARG 979 1016 We’ve launched some during September.
s9GKvjUiNB NON-ARG 1434 1806 While it’s different from a year ago very significantly with the foreign exchange impact that we have mentioned before it remains a very significant headwind as I mentioned earlier to Tony I believe we are dealing with that to a combination of hedging, price realignments [ph] cost initiatives, but on a net basis foreign exchange we will clearly by a sequential headwind.
egsPtUeHlw NON-ARG 2697 2702  Yes.
