Hey guys, I had two questions. First is on the Music business. So I think, you said recently you had tens of millions of paying subscribers. So are those paying music listeners coming from Prime, and using the mobile app, or they coming in from Echo? Any color on what's driving that uptake and converting users into paid members? Then the second question is, you mentioned efficiency gains in retail and the improvement in retail operating margin.

So, yes, we have seen over the last few quarters, improved operating margins internationally. I would say in places like Europe and Japan, we're seeing many of the efficiencies I talked about earlier on fixed head count, operations costs, infrastructure costs, and also things like marketing working to be very efficient. I would also say that, although it's smaller internationally the impact of advertising is starting to show up more and more internationally. It's growing quite quickly just as it is in North America. But you're right. We continue to invest. We're investing in India obviously, and have seen good traction there. We just passed our Fifth Year Anniversary \u2013 celebrated our Fifth Year Anniversary, as the most visited site in India. So we think there's a lot of great innovation that has continued to occur for Indian consumers and sellers, and that will continue. But you're also seeing additional expansion. So we launched Prime in Australia; we're rolling devices out. We launched Echo and Alexa in France. The Echo Spot in India and Japan, and we announced that we're going to expand Echo and Alexa soon to Italy, Mexico and Spain. So I would say that we're continuing to frontload Prime benefits in the newer geographies. So that's one of the issues that we see with operating margin. But we think it's the right thing to do. We are seeing strong traction in that front as well. We also like that the \u2013 on Prime Day, we were able to expand our list of countries that experience Prime Day; this year to Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
