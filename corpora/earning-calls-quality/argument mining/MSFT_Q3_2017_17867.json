Amy, I want to follow up on your last point around investment and return on it. Around this time last year, you guys started spending a lot more or investing a lot more in OpEx on the Intelligent Cloud side in particular. This quarter, you saw Intelligent Cloud operating profit on a constant currency basis get back to growth again, which I think shows that those investments indeed made some sense. Now that you have spent a lot, you've obviously added a lot in sales and marketing resources, R&D resources on that front. Could you just give us I guess qualitatively how you're thinking about that? It seemed like last year, you needed to catch up to a certain degree in terms of go-to-market capabilities. Do you feel better I guess where you are today versus your position, say, a year ago, just in terms of being able to capture the opportunity on the Intelligent Cloud side?
