n7soONpBGg NON-ARG 681 705 Yes and Amy you can add.
0x4JOo_I3- CLAIM-Reformulated 1905 2115 So I think all of, both of our cloud products, the major cloud products have these premium tiers that the mix shift to those or the addition of those is something that we're focused on and we see in our results
n192ny3uLd CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1231 1348 And I think the best proxy for you really beyond any numbers we talk about in terms of monthly active is our capital,
KbxA5jNMau PREMISE-Fact 1349 1529 because if you look at what we do, is we spend our capital only to really fuel the growth or to service the growth of usage across Office 365 and Azure, and you see that increasing
xhcdwuzb8s PREMISE-Fact 985 1180 And there's always lumpiness as well as increased deployment that happens once the users migrate, and we'll continue to track that and we'll continue to disclose those numbers as they come along.
CImfT3sDzG PREMISE-Fact 841 984 In fact there is always, and I think we also talked about how we get licenses sold and then, or subscriptions sold and then there's deployment.
jO8aZNhBZ2 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1181 1230 But I feel very, very good in the growth of that.
hz-s-ZdUEw PREMISE-RealExample 2256 2326 And really E5's only been in market for the last month of the quarter.
VNciWkd0rH CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2327 2423 We're excited about the number of customers that are trying it and that all the value it offers.
HkQA_LaOtR PREMISE-Fact 2424 2498 But I would expect that to be a longer term evolution as opposed to in Q2.
2MAzDZvZt7 NON-ARG 2837 2900 Yes, in my guidance comments, I talked a little bit about that.
aF5OPjfhqp CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2901 3024 On the Pro side as I mentioned, we'll have a couple point impact that would make a difference between that on the Pro side.
b2HSVMRWkE PREMISE-Other 3025 3251 And I would expect, I think we actually even talked about that last quarter, that the RPL delta which we've seen in Q1 and Q2 would go away in Q3 and Q4 and it would trend much more similarly to the overall consumer PC market.
rnKpeOJ2wD CLAIM-Fact 706 840 I mean I think, that's right, last time we talked about the 60 million monthly active users for Office 365 and that continues to grow.
RRl3VN5Y8F NON-ARG 2129 2142 That's right.
sn_f6ZoXGH PREMISE-Fact 2143 2255 I would just add that we did see that premium mix go up in Office 365 on the commercial side as you were noting.
AM5iE4xD_x PREMISE-RealExample 1531 1808 And then in terms of the margin profile, I mean the entire story of having the E3 mix first to be high and now E5, that's the thing that Amy talked about, which is we now have good premium tier value in all of our products, in Office 365 that's most evident with E3 and now E5.
S2cLbMqngV PREMISE-RealExample 1809 1904 Even in Azure, we have things like EMS, we have our data services, even our developer services.
