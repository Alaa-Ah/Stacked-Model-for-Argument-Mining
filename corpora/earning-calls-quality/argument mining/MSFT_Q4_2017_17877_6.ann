ejmYYx_21s NON-ARG 816 828 Thanks Kash.
PdmyApRP4G CLAIM-Fact 829 973 Let me go through the bookings, again with that 30% the first and best contributor to that is the strong performance on the renewals in quarter.
kMn0pDDoYZ PREMISE-Fact 974 1192 It was a reasonably consistent Kash, there was not a geo in particular that I would say was a massive outlier although in two of our largest geos, the U.S. and Germany they did have very good years in particular in Q4.
8C7fu-KGJL PREMISE-Fact 1193 1580 Now if you separate the fact that we had the larger base with clearly contribute to that bookings number being big, aside from that in particular Azure in the last year point did really show up in that 18.9, it didn't, the strong billings growth really showed up in that unearned outperformance, which you saw versus the guide and it was significant, a lot of that is the Azure fillings.
d-ft10QoMp CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1581 1672 I think we felt very good, those as well, I think we’re pretty broad-based across industry.
p6fDD1n0eM CLAIM-Reformulated 1673 1701 I would also say across geo.
lYaMXfgzaY CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1702 2201 And so while we of course get some strength from our largest geos, and I would say they were probably the largest contributors if it was actually quite broad there is not only one place for me to say that we just saw it here, and then the final component that I would say was better than we anticipated and the way you’d see that cash, again versus the unearned guidance and the beat that we had there with that final piece around our security value prop, ATP - Windows annuity growth was very good.
f0Ga3JqfRw PREMISE-Fact 2202 2261 That’s in the KPI Windows commercial products and services.
uQvBsWFOPd PREMISE-Fact 2262 2381 It is the place you will look and see that number and outside of that I mean those really are the biggest contributors.
kDqkIo3-AR CLAIM-Fact 2421 2520 Yes, I am going to - if I add one thing, I will just say that nothing shows up in just one quarter.
VDKdCk6VoO PREMISE-Fact 2521 2736 We have been working on this for a long time whether it is the product and the approach we have taken from IaaS to PaaS to SaaS, even the diversity of our SaaS offerings, and also how we think about going to market.
za-Rf-PQ7D PREMISE-Fact 2737 3168 All of these have been multiple years of hard work, and clearly there is momentum across the board, and that I think is what you are seeing and we are excited about this quarter's execution and performance, and I think it bodes well for what we do in the future, but the key is for us to recognize that this is about the sort of long-term commitment to a big opportunity in making sure that you line up your execution against that.
eYdIHnN2Ce CLAIM-Fact 3179 3413 And I think maybe, I should have also mentioned, when you think about seeing that type of performance and Satya mentioned it is not just because of work done this quarter, it is a great point, but it’s also the investments we’ve made.
BmCl8NZhCn PREMISE-Fact 3414 3453 We’ve committed, we did sales overlays.
MKV3IGcCzc PREMISE-Fact 3454 3483 We added technical resources.
4WH3VQGPhf PREMISE-Fact 3484 3675 We put resources at customers ahead of the curve, we did that you saw that and the operating in the intelligent cloud OpEx growth over the past few quarters, that execution is what’s landing.
