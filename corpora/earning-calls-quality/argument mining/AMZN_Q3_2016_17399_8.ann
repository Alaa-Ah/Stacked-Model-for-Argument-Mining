k7QFc-YTVb NON-ARG 629 633 Yes.
USEEURQduj NON-ARG 634 647 Thanks, Gene.
o3uQkhJEx0 NON-ARG 747 807 And the things I'm about to mention fall into that category.
1L0jzpXpU_ NON-ARG 808 1039 But the largest individual reasons for the ramp-up in investment between first half and second half of this year and also second half of this year versus second half of last year are the things I mentioned on the call last quarter.
iriQvT3C5x PREMISE-Fact 1040 1161 First, video content and marketing associated with that is nearly doubling year-over-year in the second half of the year.
uP7bTL2a9_ PREMISE-Fact 1162 1217 And it continues to be a large increase both Q3 and Q4.
6mle38jzBm PREMISE-Statistic 1218 1309 In the quarter, in Q3 we added 18 fulfillment centers and we've added five more in October.
4WTodVT7aT PREMISE-Statistic 1310 1336 For the year we'll add 26.
fdtcsi8OB1 PREMISE-Statistic 1337 1553 Most of those are in North America but that compares to 14 last year and I would look, looking back the last time we had double-digit increase in fulfillment centers was in 2012 when we added 11 in the third quarter.
znYKUTY1Gx CLAIM-Fact 1554 1662 So it was a rare aggregation of startups in Q3 and into Q4 that's helping us position better for Q4 volumes.
FntI9i3trU PREMISE-Fact 1663 1826 Because paid unit growth continues to be strong and Amazon fulfilled unit growth which includes what we ship, includes FBA, is significantly higher than even that.
XjKfyYfWQW CLAIM-Fact 1827 1931 So we continue to build for high AFN, or Amazon Fulfilled Network demand, including both retail and FBA.
mH8IbXBDsJ CLAIM-Policy 648 746 Well we will continue to invest in the business where we are seeing significant customer traction.
fIoOi9vEpn PREMISE-Statistic 1932 2030 The number of warehouses that we added represents a 30% increase in square footage year-over-year.
k9JWP3cfcY PREMISE-Statistic 2031 2087 Last year we increased square footage by just under 20%.
uxYyxLYBJe NON-ARG 2088 2199 The definition of square footage in this case is all of our warehouses plus our sortation and delivery centers.
eOK3D3eidR NON-ARG 2200 2249 So it's pretty much our customer service centers.
_FA6Pj3Kn2 NON-ARG 2250 2318 So it's pretty much our full square footage that supports operation.
D7i93ZYW-2 NON-ARG 2319 2362 So those will dissipate as as they burn in.
GXOpjo1n7w PREMISE-Fact 2363 2528 We've talked about fulfillment centers' initial startup costs include increase in fixed costs but also variable cost as we train workers and also bring in inventory.
cmG9N3w6dT PREMISE-Fact 2529 2657 And there's a number of transportation costs also related to the startup of a new fulfillment center, both inbound and outbound.
8ou59Mx9i_ PREMISE-Fact 2658 2881 And they're inherently less efficient than more established mature buildings, so there will be a cycle where those will be more productive next year than they are this year and more productive in 2018 than they are in 2017.
-NdyCeR4uc CLAIM-Fact 2882 3238 So what you're seeing essentially in the second half of this year is a step-up investment primarily around digital content and also the fulfillment center investment, but also things like Echo and Alexa which we're adding a lot of resources to, India and AWS as we add people there to support additional service, think (7:54) rapid growth in that business.
