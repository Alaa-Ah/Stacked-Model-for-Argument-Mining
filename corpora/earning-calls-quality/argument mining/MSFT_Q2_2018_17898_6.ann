p65dlq0HUJ PREMISE-Fact 734 1031 And we'll continue to do so, when we look at our CapEx spend we want to make sure that the data center regions meet the needs of our customers globally across both consumer workloads and enterprise workloads, where real data sovereignty requirements and speed-of-light issues are already relevant.
WgaWipTs-r PREMISE-Fact 1032 1105 Having said that, the way it fills up is by the value-add that we can do.
