So maybe for Dave, if you look at your slide deck, Page 4, what you see is just this amazing ARPU growth in the U.S. And just the size of the U.S. ARPU is so much larger than all these other markets, including Europe. I wonder when you look at the opportunity to try to drive market -- drive pricing in other markets, what are those gating factors? What are you looking for to -- or what should we look for to move pricing to be closer to where, I guess, ARPU closer to where the U.S. numbers are heading?

Europe is a broader mix of countries. So you've got Eastern Europe, and you've got Turkey in there. So you've got just lower ad market per capita countries that are included in that segment. It's a much closer number if you were to look just pure-play at Western Europe. And then there's obviously different engagement levels, maturity of Instagram in those markets that also plays into it. I guess not for the Facebook-only stats, but I think you just get different dynamics based on the, really, characteristics of those countries.  So that's really what's driven the difference in ARPUs, and you're also getting faster growth in general in the lower-ARPU countries both within Europe and within APAC.
