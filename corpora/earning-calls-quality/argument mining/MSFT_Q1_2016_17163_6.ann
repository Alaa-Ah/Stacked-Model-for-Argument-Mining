cJo2dja7dS NON-ARG 819 842 Why don't you go first.
OtoO3nHTAn NON-ARG 858 878 Yeah, I'll go first.
M97W5nJHnV CLAIM-Opinion(view) 879 1018 I think the data architecture that underlies what's happening in the enterprise underneath applications is going through a dramatic change.
v98gFU-Afb PREMISE-Fact 2170 2272 So I think we have a very rich vision and execution on what is an expanding data platform opportunity.
BddEcGEww0 NON-ARG 2273 2442 And it's nice to see us innovate on the new services while we also in what is still the big market, which is the relational database market, claim a leadership position.
qxEZ0bFWIf CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2990 3076 But I do think the more helpful KPI for us in terms of bookings is the commercial one.
lxasDJFjn9 PREMISE-Fact 2866 2988 If you want to get to total bookings, you just add back in all the consumer revenue, is technically is how you would do it
b9idgx3kKm PREMISE-Fact 2605 2865 Total bookings, because the volatility frankly in consumer businesses in times like the holiday periods, it can make it far more volatile than usually what many of you have been asking for, which is the continuity and health of the overall commercial business.
o-YALtxl7F PREMISE-Fact 1019 1171 That said, the relational database itself remains still a very strong component, but not the only component anymore, in both on-premise and off-premise.
ZdAP9Ifv3Z PREMISE-Fact 1172 1280 And what we want to make sure as a company is to cover all of that landscape with a very rich data platform.
9zfnpmCpF3 PREMISE-Fact 1281 1502 So if you look at what we're doing, the length and breadth of our ambition as well our delivery today, everything from what SQL itself is doing, we have now all in-memory workloads for OLTP, BI, data warehousing built in.
K2uc1CYTwB PREMISE-Fact 1503 1568 We have the ability to now tier even the database with the cloud.
YIQp_8Uaat CLAIM-Reformulated 1569 1649 This is all the things that are coming in SQL 2016 and we're excited about that.
34Cg_Jr4OU PREMISE-Fact 1650 1761 When it comes to the cloud itself, we have a PaaS service with SQL, which is very unique in terms of SQL Azure.
6WbpOr5u-O PREMISE-RealExample 1762 1850 We have now the Data Lake service for basically petabyte, exabyte scale data management.
vOT_LGsLod PREMISE-RealExample 1851 1986 We have higher level data services like Azure ML, which is about advanced analytics, a category we didn't even participate in the past.
FVSO2vVAYR PREMISE-RealExample 1987 2047 So we've entered that category, Revolution R fits into that.
z9ffDsKzuZ PREMISE-Fact 2048 2169 So we have a very rich story and this is not even talking about some of the other end-user BI capabilities like Power BI.
cJfHPN5yfO CLAIM-Fact 2456 2604 And Mark, on the total bookings number, the reason we moved to commercial bookings is it's a far more comparable number to look at period to period.
SkrhTDxHJG NON-ARG 3114 3121  Great.
AsckmhHrTz NON-ARG 3122 3135 Thanks, Mark.
CFBQAgBYvv NON-ARG 3136 3193 Operator, we'll have time for one final question, please.
