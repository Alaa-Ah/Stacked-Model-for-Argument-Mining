ttg3itFslA CLAIM-Fact 1315 1423 So the gross margin rate of these services is clearly significantly dilutive to the overall Services margin.
Pe5nEn78G1 CLAIM-Fact 1139 1237 So total revenue has not changed, we just report that estimated value under the Services category.
AFJSQkPGRE NON-ARG 458 538 Yes in essence when we sell a product at a certain price, we make an assumption.
mvxLWKrYGy NON-ARG 539 611 We estimate the value that can be associated to providing free services.
LJmZIkgCSf NON-ARG 612 743 In our case, it's providing Maps services, providing Siri and providing free iCloud to all the customers that purchase our product.
TgZJMJQQLL NON-ARG 744 783 And so we calculate an estimated value.
MlACKofNbh PREMISE-Fact 784 896 That value gets deferred and gets amortized over the estimated period of time that we deliver the free services.
dm8dt9-D9T PREMISE-Fact 897 983 In the past that deferral and the subsequent amortization was reported under products.
yKg_7Ma0HS PREMISE-Fact 984 1138 Now in connection with the new revenue recognition standard, we are reclassifying essentially that amortization from products revenue to services revenue.
tt1uCMyMdx PREMISE-Fact 1238 1314 We also reclassify the cost that we need to incur to provide those services.
WyD7w-tcUt PREMISE-Fact 2542 2630 And I mentioned that the percentage of paid accounts has increased strong double-digits.
AkEIcddIMp PREMISE-Statistic 2211 2263 We've added 100 million in the last 12 months alone.
j55vz8CNAW PREMISE-RealExample 2893 3021 During the last three years, we've added Apple Pay, which has been incredibly successful and is a wonderful customer experience.
LTIzoAR_Nc PREMISE-RealExample 3022 3137 We've added Apple Music, where we now have more than 50 million paid subscribers and continues to grow very nicely.
K9nUKIPQ3v PREMISE-RealExample 3138 3194 And we've added a very useful service to our developers.
X8wSCLXFM1 PREMISE-RealExample 3195 3261 We provide an advertising service for developers in the App Store.
HRHNITn6mE CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3262 3431 The way we've added these services in the past, obviously, we're also very interested in adding new services that can provide great value to our customers in the future.
ngsZ_YMAuq NON-ARG 2264 2289 So that's the first step.
HvKmwtvKpI NON-ARG 1995 1999 Yes.
xQlEJfmcFZ NON-ARG 2000 2098 I mean as I said I mean essentially what -- services -- I said services too is our installed base.
4j1_DLOqRp NON-ARG 3432 3533 Now we don't want to get into product announcements here, but obviously that is part of our strategy.
FAd5narUZ6 CLAIM-Fact 2739 2810 and so we are accepting more and more payment methods around the world.
CuPB9C0ouK PREMISE-Fact 2666 2738 We want to make it easier for our customers to actually use our services
w9pd3Jeng3 CLAIM-Fact 2099 2149 So the first driver is growing the installed base.
9DHjanh7Tj PREMISE-Fact 2150 2210 Installed base has grown nicely over the last several years.
VSAaHjwS4g CLAIM-Fact 2290 2541 Then within that installed base, of course we want to make sure that there are more people that are so interested in our services that in addition to transacting on those services on a free basis, they also are interested in paying for those services.
5KfUh3MXY1 PREMISE-Fact 2631 2665 So we want to continue to do that.
9yauqbyx6G CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2811 2892 And clearly, as you said the idea of adding new services is very important to us.
YQOpqWaqtC NON-ARG 1423 1438  I hope I've...
