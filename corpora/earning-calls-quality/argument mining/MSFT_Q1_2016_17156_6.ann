Vgw87gX8mZ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 642 803 The way to really think about that number just because of some of the seasonality in our business, Mark, is to think about the year-over-year growth rate of 70%.
PY94JrSrLq PREMISE-Other 804 872 For me that is more symbolic of how you should think about the pace.
JFYKqx87ij PREMISE-Fact 873 935 And that is a very fast number on a increasingly growing base.
1UvDGhchpO CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1669 1893 We're still focused on continuing to have that sequential improvement, and especially as some of the things Satya talked about, which is the addition of premium services, the pace of innovation especially on the premium end.
9BkLWeJNNu PREMISE-RealExample 1426 1623 Looking in the old segments, I know you all have done, we saw a year-over-year improvement in the overall commercial other segment that we disclosed this time too of about 10 points year over year.
TPK3KH96EW PREMISE-Statistic 1624 1668 We saw sequential improvement from Q4 to Q1.
Ghzxy5O4iM CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1894 2123 And if you think about our launch of E5, which is a premium SKU in Office 365, it continues to give us the opportunity to both get more efficient in the infrastructure and to add higher margin products especially at the fast end.
iYSUzXgiVR NON-ARG 1412 1425 Thanks, Mark.
VJK3uKwMy2 PREMISE-Fact 2139 2352 Yeah, just one thing that's structurally I think, that we think a lot about and we're very disciplined about is our capital allows us to build all of the cloud services from Office 365 to EMS to Dynamics to Azure.
7ZGRLEzRS_ PREMISE-Fact 2353 2430 And that diversity of workloads long term is what lead to margin improvement.
lz1ghIb1pa CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2431 2662 And there will be changes in seasonality from quarter to quarter, but structurally those two things, the diversity of what we are doing and how capital is utilized across all of it is I think a big structural differentiator for us.
