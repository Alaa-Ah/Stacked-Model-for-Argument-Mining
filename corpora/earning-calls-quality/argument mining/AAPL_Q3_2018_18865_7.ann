_uL-pMbrG9 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 805 879 I think the home business, Laura, is bigger than the HomePod and Apple TV.
fLRyOtaldY PREMISE-Fact 880 1040 They're both important products clearly, but everybody has their iPhone at home as well and everybody has their Mac at home and everyone has their iPad at home.
rulmJ3btSG PREMISE-Statistic 1041 1258 And so in terms of the Siri access point, as you can tell from the 100 billion number I quoted in the script, there's an extraordinary amount of usage of these products that are used to perform home-related functions.
2kBIQr1Ucu PREMISE-Fact 1259 1342 I do that every day with controlling all my home automation and so on and so forth.
azsF3wp8VD CLAIM-Reformulated 1472 1490 Home is important.
k0UXaiM4em CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1491 1509 Work is important.
0COJn5ENUY CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1510 1553 The movement between the two are important.
V1J-DlDOQL CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1554 1574 Health is important.
q-x_25X0ZZ CLAIM-Reformulated 1575 1788 So the smartphone has become the repository that goes across the whole of your life, not something that is just meant for a portion of it and so I think all of those are important and we're focused on all of them.
cd_km2GxlD NON-ARG 1862 1887 Thanks for your question.
AAJ3cTDMPs CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1343 1471 Part of that is on HomePod but part of it is with the Apple Watch and the iPhone and the iPad, and so I think home is important.
gRBJ52KEOP PREMISE-Fact 2492 2629 A lot of people that buy Apple products buy for the whole ecosystem, even though they might not currently use all the different products.
ocm7KTIa0n CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2630 2728 And so the way that I think about those products are they're products within the ecosystem itself.
cLFpVF172b CLAIM-Reformulated 2930 3011 And so in my view, this is a part of the â€“ they are a core part of the ecosystem.
leJEeQcIRM PREMISE-Fact 2729 2929 And there's the AirPods have really gone through the roof and the Apple Watch has hit an air pocket and has gone to a whole different level as I'd mentioned earlier with our overall wearables revenue.

eeAt9NqE0F NON-ARG 4572 4600 Thanks again for joining us.
vYXY9KoSDU CLAIM-Fact 3172 3333 It is, well, but on your point though, it is clear from communications I've had with users that some of them were attracted to iPhone because of the Apple Watch.
LwVV8kP1td CLAIM-Reformulated 3380 3422 So the Apple Watch led them to the iPhone.
3fJ6pz5uvr CLAIM-Fact 3423 3672 The reverse of that is also true, is that somebody got the iPhone and then decided I really want something to coach me in fitness and to curate some of the communications and so forth like the watch does so well and so it's not always a linear path.
yYoqm7p-HC CLAIM-Reformulated 3673 3744 I see these things as being somewhat fluid and different for each user.
