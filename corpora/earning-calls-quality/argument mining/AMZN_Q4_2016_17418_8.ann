NPWnfN66k3 NON-ARG 718 723 Sure.
rI-3gmjnO8 NON-ARG 724 751 Let me start with the Echo.
24qav3gJs5 NON-ARG 752 868 So I don't think I'm going to answer your exact question there on quantifying the retail sales through Echo devices.
_FUEnzM-hU CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1339 1432 We're really glad to see that and that creates a great base of Echo and Alexa fans out there.
rNrHidFEBe PREMISE-Statistic 1433 1645 We've added 4,000 skills to Alexa since I last spoke to you in October and we're working with a lot of major companies as they add abilities, too, for our customer base to use the Alexa or the Echo to reach them.
AXoJ6pWzQz PREMISE-Fact 1646 1712 Tens of thousands of developers are building new skills for Alexa.
1i00RsvUwt CLAIM-Fact 1713 1753 So, the skills addition should continue.
1YZfi95J8D PREMISE-Fact 1754 1937 And just as importantly, tens of thousands of developers are also using the Alexa Voice Service to help integrate Alexa into their products, which then creates a great network effect.
YkMUOYG1Lj NON-ARG 2266 2275 Hi, Mark.
f4gYDo74mJ NON-ARG 2276 2290 This is Darin.
QMO7kHFrxI NON-ARG 1938 1965 We're doing that ourselves.
6o4Rd23itl PREMISE-RealExample 1966 2080 If you've seen in the quarter, we added Alexa capabilities to our tablets and Fire TV devices, making them better.
zDtdEAsVpl CLAIM-Reformulated 2081 2251 So it's a great, again, part of the flywheel in that, Echo and Alexa make the devices better and it builds engagement, not only with Echo and Alexa, but also with Amazon.
s6tXfCbMnN NON-ARG 2291 2354 On the customer count, no absolute number to give this quarter.
NgOee4cETb CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2512 2557 What we do like is the engagement with Prime.
AcxeUYXDVT CLAIM-Reformulated 2744 2805 So we're very pleased with our customer engagement this year.
gfI05xB-bw PREMISE-Fact 2558 2743 We continue to add Prime members and similar to the flywheel that Brian was just mentioning, that the FBA selection helps us with engaging customers and in particular the Prime program.
Cwd7s1Hbei PREMISE-Statistic 2355 2511 As you know, back in Q1 we gave an active customer count that exceeded 300 million and I can say it's still growing and we're pleased with the number there.
HnWbw3lnat PREMISE-Statistic 1184 1309 As we mentioned in our press release, the unit sales of Echoes grew nine times, 9x, year-over-year during the holiday period.
C99CPhV-Ec PREMISE-Fact 1310 1338 So, great customer adoption.
rwMppCepro NON-ARG 868 928  It's still very early days on that, so that's not material.
sFuwjroiPs NON-ARG 929 1012 But the engagement is just like any other Prime benefit or investment that we have.
xdlJGbqRZo NON-ARG 1013 1094 We do look at engagement and we like the engagement of customers who have Echoes.
exoIQZNxwy NON-ARG 1095 1183 But let me step back a minute and give some highlights on that, Alexa and Echo together.
