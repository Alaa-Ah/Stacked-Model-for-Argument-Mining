vEz9oc3Rdl PREMISE-Fact 247 404 We continue to see people moving over to iOS and it helped with us making the results that Luca announced earlier, including the channel inventory reduction.
JUaYdQ4xee NON-ARG 897 902 Sure.
y5R4t1Nf0m NON-ARG 903 1043 Starting with the U.S., let me just take this question from what are we doing to increase jobs, which I think is probably where it's rooted.
lcQ3jTWZhn CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1044 1121 We've created 2 million jobs in the U.S., and we're incredibly proud of that.
r_o5see4C4 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1122 1281 We do view that we have a responsibility in the U.S. to increase economic activity, including increasing jobs, because Apple could have only been created here.
owfZ5Cgjvv CLAIM-Fact 1282 1439 And so as we look at that 2 million, there are three main categories of that, and we have actions going on in each of them to further build on that momentum.
gMEkX6dsns CLAIM-Fact 1440 1478 The first category is app development.
YokCN5fhF_ PREMISE-Statistic 1479 1536 About three-quarters of the 2 million are app developers.
_dg8kBZpct PREMISE-RealExample 1537 1740 And we're doing an enormous amount of things to deliver curriculum to both K-12 with Swift Playgrounds in the K-to-6 area, other curriculum as you proceed beyond grade 6 under the Everyone Can Code area.
-V7YGqB2Xi PREMISE-Fact 1741 1974 And just a couple months ago, we announced a new curriculum that's focused on community schools and community colleges, junior colleges, technical colleges, for kids that did not have coding in their elementary and high school years.
Uddeo_w_84 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1975 2100 And so we're excited about that because we think it could increase the diversity of the developer community and the quantity.
DGxlacd8c_ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2101 2239 And I think this area in general and all the things we do for the developer community will be the largest contribution that Apple can make
TQwpejrhZ3 PREMISE-Other 2240 2344 because this is the fastest growing job segment in the country, and I think will be for quite some time.
6dE0U07c8q CLAIM-Fact 2345 2495 If you look at the second area, we have purchased â€“ or we purchased last year about $50 billion worth of goods and services from U.S.-based suppliers.
qI9kWznZMr CLAIM-Fact 2496 2618 Some significant portion of those are manufacturing-related, and so we've asked ourselves what can we do to increase this.
BOUL8SbODT PREMISE-Statistic 2619 2804 And you may have seen that at the beginning of the quarter, sometime in April I believe, we announced a fund, an Advanced Manufacturing Fund, that we're initially placing $1 billion in.
CjgISNtHa9 PREMISE-Fact 2805 2853 And we've already deployed $200 million of that.
2JghjFxtOj PREMISE-RealExample 2854 2984 And the first recipient is Corning in Kentucky, and they'll be using that money to expand the plant to make very innovative glass.
ys2A3sKEPB PREMISE-Fact 2985 3074 And we purchase that glass and essentially export it to the world with iPhones and iPads.
c2SFHP4Agm CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3075 3121 We think there's more of these that we can do.
G_p-2UOTNw CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3122 3318 I think there are probably several plants that can benefit from having some investment to grow or expand or even maybe set up shop in the U.S. for the first time, so we're very excited about that.
mPnJPRv-d4 CLAIM-Fact 3319 3539 And then the third area is we have about two-thirds or so of our total employee base is in the U.S. despite only a third of our revenues being here, and we'll have some things that we'll say about that later in the year.
kWUEJzeriy CLAIM-Reformulated 3540 3639 And so that's what we're doing from a job growth point of view, and we're very, very proud of that.
r8DLZVYKbq NON-ARG 3640 3748 Now turning to China, let me comment on what I assumed is at the root of your question about this VPN issue.
T18znNigFU NON-ARG 3749 3782 Let me just address that head on.
5I5xQnnecu NON-ARG 3783 3932 The central government in China back in 2015 started tightening the regulations associated with VPN apps, and we have a number of those on our store.
uM3x6DhXOB NON-ARG 3933 4047 Essentially, as a requirement for someone to operate a VPN, they have to have a license from the government there.
Wi5W1EiBEd NON-ARG 4048 4246 Earlier this year, they began a renewed effort to enforce that policy, and we were required by the government to remove some of the VPN apps from the App Store that don't meet these new regulations.
fo2HkH59kZ NON-ARG 4247 4364 We understand that those same requirements are on other app stores, and as we checked through that, that is the case.
jXp_xapleU CLAIM-Fact 4365 4540 Today there are actually still hundreds of VPN apps on the App Store, including hundreds by developers that are outside China, and so there continues to be VPN apps available.
JjzOEY60YL CLAIM-Fact 4541 4665 We would obviously rather not remove the apps, but like we do in other countries, we follow the law wherever we do business.
ghaGn1A6sJ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4666 4829 And we strongly believe that participating in markets and bringing benefits to customers is in the best interest of the folks there and in other countries as well.
e_m6zii2Ic CLAIM-Reformulated 4830 4899 And so we believe in engaging with governments even when we disagree.
OM2g7cQQuw NON-ARG 5162 5218 And so that's what we're seeing from that point of view.
bFW-FlebHx NON-ARG 5219 5312 Some folks have tried to link it to the U.S. situation last year, and they're very different.
NeEp5y3I74 NON-ARG 5313 5393 In the case of the U.S., the law in the U.S. supported us, which was very clear.
sKdch5RGtV NON-ARG 5394 5449 In the case of China, the law is also very clear there.
SN3rKQnlGp NON-ARG 5450 5623 And like we would if the U.S. changed the law here, we'd have to abide by them in both cases, that doesn't mean that we don't state our point of view in the appropriate way.
U7WQHug6Ol NON-ARG 5624 5642 We always do that.
Z2oVqu150i NON-ARG 5643 5744 And so hopefully that's a little bit probably more than you wanted to know, but I wanted to tell you.
NN4fOuuS3A NON-ARG 5789 5806 Thank you, Steve.
bTJ0tTQDKc NON-ARG 5807 5847 Could we have the next question, please?
zAM1yXFaib CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4900 5161 And in this particular case, now back to commenting on this one, we're hopeful that over time the restrictions that we're seeing are loosened because innovation really requires freedom to collaborate and communicate, and I know that that is a major focus there.
0FAEpr5NcP NON-ARG 163 168 Sure.
U8cuqjzbgR CLAIM-Opinion(view) 169 246 Switching outside of China was up year-on-year, and so we're happy with that.
