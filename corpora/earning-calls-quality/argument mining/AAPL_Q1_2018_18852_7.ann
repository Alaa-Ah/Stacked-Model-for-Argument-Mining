Qb13397hm6 NON-ARG 479 500 It’s a good question.
momHVrfpow PREMISE-Fact 501 566 Keep in mind that this year had 13 weeks, last year had 14 weeks.
yy62VTL9p7 PREMISE-Statistic 808 967 And specifically the numbers this quarter as reported are 11% increase for Greater China year-over-year but on an average weekly revenue basis, we were up 19%.
-cvn79cVGw PREMISE-Fact 968 1045 Also Mainland China, we had an all-time record for revenue in Mainland China.
ZILLuTtcJL PREMISE-Fact 1046 1090 And of course a key part of that was iPhone.
WcgLRgxEYX PREMISE-Statistic 1091 1207 And as I’ve mentioned before, Kantar reported that the top five selling smartphones in urban China were all iPhones.
3SaoaVY5Wf CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1208 1265 And so we could not be more pleased with how we're doing.
_KEJ8prM_b PREMISE-Fact 1266 1464 And if you look at the other -- we obviously grew share for iPhone in the quarter, but we also grew share in iPad and Mac during the quarter and wearables were extremely strong there in the quarter.
-xa73GXRtV CLAIM-Reformulated 1465 1541 And so everywhere I look, I feel really good about how we're doing in China.
EjMUWkDv9c CLAIM-Fact 567 807 And so even though we were reporting a similar year-over-year growth for Greater China, if you change that reporting to an average weekly sales, which probably is much better way to look at it, there was actually a really nice acceleration.
DB20UMQbX0 NON-ARG 2051 2090 Let me answer, Amit, starting with M&A.
-oyuGiPmC3 NON-ARG 2091 2174 Our thought process around M&A has always been the same, and really doesn't change.
fRNHVXXw05 CLAIM-Fact 2175 2221 We've been acquiring companies over the years.
zuMYOEMRVz PREMISE-Statistic 2222 2268 In calendar 2017, we've acquired 19 companies.
UmBKfPqtaE PREMISE-Fact 2269 2452 And the thought process is always to acquire something that allows us to either accelerate our product roadmaps, filling gap in our portfolio, providing a new experience to customers.
ibjLjHhGvD PREMISE-Fact 2453 2531 So it's always with the customer experience in mind that we make acquisitions.
40SFWSyrF0 CLAIM-Fact 2532 2584 We look at all sizes, and we will continue to do so.
0i56FCJ_r6 CLAIM-Fact 2585 2636 We have plenty of financial flexibility, of course.
3uw7wsDwrN PREMISE-Fact 2637 2674 We had that even prior to tax reform.
KLjvZIi8wy CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2837 2882 And so we’ll try to be to be very thoughtful.
QmHT-WV9r8 PREMISE-Statistic 2883 2980 As we said, $163 billion is a large amount and there are even practical considerations around it.
U8Rn5882MJ NON-ARG 2981 2994 So we'll see.

Eg_2oRvsVN PREMISE-Other 2675 2836 And as I said, we will talk about capital allocation plans when we report at the March quarter and that will include talking about timeframes and pace and so on.
gIKoWZvBHI NON-ARG 3004 3048  And just for clarity, let me add one thing.
HgphbjWLVa NON-ARG 3049 3093 What Luca is saying is not cash equals zero.
