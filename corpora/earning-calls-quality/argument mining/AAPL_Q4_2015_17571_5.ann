ZBycMQKdTO NON-ARG 915 935 There's a lot there.
DZmPOdbgvp NON-ARG 936 975 Let me start with the Android Switcher.
iIheZJBxCh CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1403 1469 And so, it’s a huge number, we're very, very proud of that number.
3JkTNAfwlz PREMISE-Fact 1265 1402 And so that's what that means, and that number is the largest that we've ever recorded since we began measuring it three or so years ago.
T_TmEC37Ou PREMISE-Statistic 976 1126 What this means is that for customers to purchase an iPhone last quarter and replace the smartphone that 30% of those switched from an android device.
xVXHOeLF9V PREMISE-Other 1127 1264 And so there would have been some switchers on top of that from other operating systems, but obviously android is the largest one by far.
frNbIWswDN NON-ARG 1470 1535 In terms of 2016 versus 2015 new customers, it's hard to predict.
ZmqFqKHUuk NON-ARG 1536 1572 I'm very happy with how we're doing.
biEDcbGSgA NON-ARG 1573 1619 We're doing better than we've ever been doing.
tfitNTWPyh NON-ARG 1620 1676 People -- I know there's a fixation on the upgrade rate.
Hd-wim86YH PREMISE-RealExample 2974 3159 But if you look at iPad as just an example, in China, 68% of the people that purchased an iPad it was the first tablet they've owned and 40% of those have never owned any Apple product.
5jUdFKrZKl CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1947 1983 And so, I'd see that is opportunity.
P8EuAwEqIB CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3372 3427 And the first time buyer number is surprisingly strong.
oRGDvKQaVP NON-ARG 3545 3588 They begin to look at other Apple products.
nkZvvBLICT NON-ARG 3589 3640 And of course we makes they all work well together.
uZEXJbCGVg NON-ARG 3160 3214 Just to go through one product with one set of number.
bdzWsHvwhN NON-ARG 3215 3322 I don't want to get through a bunch of numbers because it does contain the data than I don't want to share.
tuJwdJkedy NON-ARG 3323 3371 But these are things that we're very focused on.
RbvtvHstcu NON-ARG 1984 2042 Do I think it has anything, does to length to consistency?
NgzheHtPFM NON-ARG 2043 2182 I think part of it is and I believe that the iPhone upgrade plans that are out there as I've mentioned before it seems to me on the future.
OqBYFBngFD NON-ARG 2183 2299 We'll tell it’s true or not, but it seems to me it’s going to act as a catalyst to accelerate some of this upgrades.
KVdscDdUVD NON-ARG 2300 2457 And I think that's not something that we're going to see this quarter or next quarter, but it seems like it’s going to happen beginning a year for now or so.
JgZzkoRkoy NON-ARG 2458 2502 It have begins to be – you've seen the plan.
PTZdXCGCOc NON-ARG 2503 2578 They look more and active like a subscription than they do like a purchase.
VqNFlnqDtH NON-ARG 2579 2709 And that's great for the customer because many of them want to upgrade on a frequent basis and they can do this very, very simply.
ljcmNpIihZ NON-ARG 2710 2771 In terms of new, I don't know, whether we'll more new or not.
haflArqaaf NON-ARG 2772 2820 I can tell you that that's always our objective.
JRWDDwvbtc NON-ARG 2821 2973 We want to add a lot more people to the ecosystem and certainly if you look in the emerging markets, even like, nobody is asking about iPad on the call.
0UE0Jw46UT PREMISE-Fact 3428 3544 And keep in mind that we have a good history of bunch of people buy one Apple product, they have a great experience.
qxeJ0GzicP PREMISE-Statistic 1677 1923 When I look at the upgrade rate, Steve, what I see is I feel good that it’s a low number because that's low number means that there is 69% of the people that are out there prior to the iPhone 6 and 6 plus that haven't bother to upgrade this year.
ACR3SvKe6o PREMISE-Fact 1924 1946 That's a large number.
