bnp9dlhE0O NON-ARG 448 462 Thanks Walter.
a6KYomCwVm NON-ARG 463 528 Is that both your questions, I just want to make sure I get them?
oH9ksQ3HWi NON-ARG 653 697 I'll just start by just talking about China.
KhhYvoTFQM CLAIM-Fact 698 782 We have in China currently a set of geopolitical issues that we are working through.
edh8dIpmLU PREMISE-Fact 783 825 We're very committed to China as a market.
e5rf59OTdm NON-ARG 2122 2136 Thanks Walter.
8CThD56OaE CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2137 2505 I think with all products, I think about the complete sales cycle and I am really encouraged by the fact that we're doing a good job of moving from the initial sales through deployment, through adding on services and back to renewals and I think the importance of that customer lifecycle is really how we think about our workloads and our workload health in the cloud.
Q8H7zMd_yW PREMISE-Fact 2506 2570 The workload that we're furthest along on is obviously exchange.
3rUJj0W9JO PREMISE-Fact 2571 2731 It happens also come with directory implementation and so we generally think of a fast deployment also and then adding on workloads and premium workflow cycles.
pQM3VfOzPc PREMISE-RealExample 2732 2943 And then as you might imagine, that provides an interesting environment for us to add on some of the products actually that Satya mentioned very directly in his comments such as EMS or Enterprise Mobility Suite.
pr79j08qeN PREMISE-Fact 826 1083 We have in fact pockets of good growth in China with our cloud doing fairly well, but at the same time we're grounded that in the fact that we need more work to do and we're working through them and then as and when they will work out, we will let you know.
-Hc1vlQzS1 NON-ARG 2944 3157 So while I think there is always a lag, the actual goal is the commitment that the customers show to the movement to the cloud and then moving them quickly as we can, but also at their own pace through deployment.

Tq0w0SiTEk CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1094 1507 And I'll talk a little bit about Japan and Walter to answer your question, I don't have any concerns if that expands such that in this unique issue beyond Japan, with the Windows end of XP plus the VAT increase, I do think, as well as some of the macroeconomic environments, it tightened far faster than we had anticipated and Japan in particular because of its model for us, it is a non-annuity geography for us.
-SuTF3cVsh CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1508 1791 So impacts in Japan more directly come to the P&L as opposed to on our under C&B balances and that's why this quarter, you saw some weakness in commercial licensing, but when adjusted for FX, our unearned balance and bookings actually felt quite good from our commercial perspective.
GOlBTAdkHj NON-ARG 3234 3274  We'll move to the next question please.
