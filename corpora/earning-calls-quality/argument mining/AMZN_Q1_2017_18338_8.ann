73Ibvbp4Oh NON-ARG 1037 1048 Sure, Mark.
vrJ1ylzuK7 NON-ARG 1049 1091 Let me start with the Echo question first.
CC2PX8IhT6 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1092 1170 So, yeah, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products.
PG6-yQW6GR NON-ARG 1171 1328 Not only the Echo products but the ability to use tablets, our tablets now as Echo devices, since we've spread the Alexa technology to many of those devices.
XnZSXdxS4R CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1329 1393 And we're also happy with the success we've had with developers.
PrgoSDpcxg PREMISE-Statistic 1394 1431 There's now over 12,000 Alexa skills.
_-tcTI3kqB CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1432 1468 So we think that's all foundational.
KhkWpIy1T4 NON-ARG 1469 1538 The monetization, as you might call it, is a theme of your questions.
GdgZWg9KQg CLAIM-Fact 1539 1578 That's not our primary issue right now.
YIDGn9rdi1 PREMISE-Fact 1579 1639 It's about building great products and delighting customers.
9wcU6OKDBT PREMISE-Fact 1640 1755 We think as engagement – as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole.
J3ZWREvrAA PREMISE-Fact 1756 1913 So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone, or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us.
FM2FNUT9sI CLAIM-Reformulated 1914 1957 So, very pleased with the initial progress.
kHltLj4Mow CLAIM-Fact 1958 2015 We see a lot of momentum there and we continue to invest.
TLK-tgBLFo NON-ARG 2016 2104 And that's one of the answers to your second question on North America operating margin.
bhfi12Cj5X NON-ARG 2105 2169 So if I step back, let me just talk generally about investments.
Gh75AQdic_ NON-ARG 2170 2241 So right now, we're just seeing a lot of great opportunities before us.
dIpM7hKYp1 NON-ARG 2242 2324 And we're continuing to ramp up the investments in pursuit of those opportunities.
eSJw7nx_ic NON-ARG 2325 2511 And the big picture is, again, as we've said customers – the things customers love can grow to be large, we'll have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades.
rTWC4P7ZwZ PREMISE-Fact 2512 2631 So in that category, and some of the things that we're investing the most in are as you say the Echo and Alexa devices.
RgPbvdzkKR PREMISE-Fact 2632 2782 We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall.
hIcAqw5Jsy CLAIM-Fact 2783 2862 So, we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing.
-yuSc0lzpx PREMISE-Fact 2863 2943 As I said earlier, we're expanding Prime benefits in the U.S. and also globally.
Jd1ehSbo6H PREMISE-Fact 2944 3017 Things like Prime Music, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, all expanding globally.
eHHoJwd8Ns PREMISE-Fact 3156 3339 We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled unit is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity.
TJ1YXOBbvA PREMISE-Fact 3340 3431 We're also investing in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning.
WvyiA7Y8ug PREMISE-Fact 3432 3559 You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we have developed in Seattle, drones.
j0TU6goX9c PREMISE-Fact 3560 3672 We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses and we're also developing services for AWS customers.
2xKLHOtdhE CLAIM-Fact 3673 3804 So – and that's of course another area is AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so at an accelerating rate.
O3wP5HNvbo NON-ARG 3805 3850 So there's a long list, and I can keep going.
suWlmcsgWF NON-ARG 3851 3998 But I think the general theme is there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about, and we continue to ramp those investments.
zpkkVUHSZO NON-ARG 3999 4134 In North America, that manifests itself mostly in the device area, the content area and also the expansion of the fulfillment networks.
aFgbaYL6Lp PREMISE-Fact 3018 3072 And we have launched Prime in India, China and Mexico.
a7FWJR-LCD PREMISE-Fact 3073 3155 I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme.
