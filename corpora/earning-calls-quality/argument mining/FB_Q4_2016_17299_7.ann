3l1_XhuwWe NON-ARG 781 843 So I'll take video first and then I can talk about VR as well.
-cahDikcwR CLAIM-Fact 844 1246 So, for the video tab, the goal that we have for the product experience is to make it so that when people want to watch videos or they want to keep up to date on what's going on with their favorite show or what's going on with the public figure that they want to follow, that they can come to Facebook and go to a place knowing that that's going to show them all the content that they're interested in.
Og1qOXUzuY PREMISE-Fact 1247 1322 So that's a pretty different intent than how people come to Facebook today.
B43pxeBBjr PREMISE-Fact 1323 1534 Today, for the most part, people pull Facebook out when they have a few minutes, when they want to catch up and see what's going on in the world with their friends and in the news and everything that's going on.
Ie1O0J5NJb PREMISE-Fact 1535 1609 That's very different from saying, hey, I want to watch video content now.
Ue-aGwahE9 PREMISE-Fact 1610 1670 And that's what I think we're going to unlock with this tab.
Ld0aGTGc5f CLAIM-Fact 1671 1743 So, all of the content that is on Facebook is eligible to go in the tab.
RPg0etjGWr PREMISE-Fact 1744 1896 I mean, we're showing video content, not all the rest of it, but there isn't a concrete difference between what can be a News Feed and what can be here.
Cp3mrRg_W1 PREMISE-Fact 1897 2128 It's just that the experience is designed to deliver on that promise of, you want to watch videos, you want to keep up with the content that you watch episodically week-over-week, this is going to the place where you go to do that.
x1WUbKDOKA CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2129 2237 I do think that it's going to get a lot stronger once the business model really starts to click here, right?
6nVKjjfhid PREMISE-Fact 2238 2401 Because a lot of the best episodic content is professionally created, and those folks need to make a good amount of money in order to support their business model.
dkcR7BN4-G CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2402 2605 So having mid-roll ads, we're committed to doing this in a way that's very good on the user experience, but that is going to enable the kind of content that I think is going to take us to the next level.
SNWR2uTTfP PREMISE-Fact 2606 2830 The early trends are good, but I think this is really going to be an area that is proportional to the amount of quality content that is in the system, and the business model is really going to be the thing that enables that.
dbrZsEctQq NON-ARG 2831 2841 All right.
GCjEUwosqB NON-ARG 2842 2848 Sorry.
gVaEQRaiqx NON-ARG 2849 2882 I forgot about that for a second.
GPQMILaoZE NON-ARG 2883 2893 All right.
5ON1lQJKn5 PREMISE-Fact 2894 2933 So VR and AR, what can accelerate that?
KPIr77AlmK CLAIM-Fact 2934 3065 I think that there are parts of this that are on a good trajectory and parts where we're a little behind where we would want to be.
2fLUo0lHAv PREMISE-Statistic 3066 3110 I think Samsung shipping 5 million Gear VRs.
2uPjUD6Efm PREMISE-Fact 3111 3190 I mean, that's their product, not ours, but we build technology that powers it.
yGViMqDSYX CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3191 3395 I think that's quite a good result, right, and one that we're very happy with, and just shows how strong of a company Samsung is at being able to build these products and sell them through into the world.
zyzv1QnLLY PREMISE-Fact 3396 3481 On the side of the products that we built, Rift and Touch were both a little delayed,
DFakCyqzJB CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3482 3533 so that was obviously somewhat of a disappointment.
fRpXgRXkQO PREMISE-Fact 3534 3645 And if you want to accelerate development, obviously, we need to get our products in the market at a good pace.
Qp4XuG3nUm PREMISE-Fact 3646 3744 But in terms of the content development, I actually think that that's coming at a reasonable clip.
G8aQIzlg8F PREMISE-Fact 3745 4000 Early on, there is this issue, which is that if you're a AAA game developer, until there's a certain volume of units in the field, you're not going to be able to make enough money to fund your game development just based off of people buying your content.
b9fHgH9mL7 CLAIM-Fact 4001 4176 So that's why we're investing so much capital in content to feed the ecosystem and solve this chicken and egg problem if you need the content in order to create the ecosystem.
mq4AC4aENf CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4177 4312 But I don't think that there is really a strategy to pull this in from 10 years to five, I just think it's going to be a 10-year thing.
fvg0S30jw- PREMISE-RealExample 4313 4470 The analogy that I always use is the first smartphones came out in 2003, right, the BlackBerry and Palm Treo, and it took 10 years to get to 1 billion units.
Lg8LcEeMtm PREMISE-Fact 4471 4606 And, I mean, I don't know if there was something that folks could have done to make that happen fast, but I think that was pretty good.
3szlsJTNYK NON-ARG 4607 4814 And, I mean, if we can be on a similar trajectory of anywhere near 10 years for VR and AR, then I would feel very good about that, and I feel like we're making the right bets now to plant the seeds for that.
17LIBYfCZ0 NON-ARG 4815 5011 But I would ask for the patience of the investor community in doing that because we're going to invest a lot in this, and it's not going to return or be really profitable for us for quite a while.
oNOsduFFYS NON-ARG 5029 5075  Operator, we have time for one last question.
