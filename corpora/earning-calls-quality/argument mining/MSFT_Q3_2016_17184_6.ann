5NMS_Bgbd8 NON-ARG 601 625 Thanks for the question.
6DzHaSF-yt CLAIM-Fact 626 736 So the decision logic was driven primarily by what I would say is the increased competitiveness of SQL Server.
Lw7WkmnkfH PREMISE-Fact 737 967 If you think about where SQL Server now with this new release, SQL Server 2016, it's become a fantastic database for many, many of the workloads, everything from OLTP to data warehousing to BI to advanced analytics for the Tier 1.
2S6SEsFhen PREMISE-Fact 968 1250 This is a capability that's been multiple decades in the work, but here we are with very competitive total cost of ownership price competitiveness, but with a technology that is in many cases, as Gartner talks about, at the top of the charts when it comes to all of these workloads.
scNCPHZUNp PREMISE-Fact 1251 1559 So now that we find ourselves at that capability, we're saying look, what's the way to think about all the markets that we can in fact take this product to, and the Linux operating system database market is not something that, which is mostly primarily a Tier 1 segment, is something that we never worked in.
ysJIzVwT4f PREMISE-Fact 1560 1639 And so therefore, we look at that as an expansion opportunity, so we take that.
wLGWRWjSgk CLAIM-Fact 1640 1704 We've already made the call that Azure for Linux is first class.
EkfVLH7DEY PREMISE-Statistic 1705 1880 We already have 20 plus points of, or 20%-plus of VMs in Azure are Linux, and we'll all increasingly have Linux be a big share of our percentage of what is happening in Azure.
sRkYTap5is CLAIM-Fact 1881 2016 So for the first time now, we have the ability to go to an enterprise and talk about their entire data estate across Windows and Linux.
-4pEjBHvLU PREMISE-Fact 2017 2072 Now people don't really move between operating systems.
Bk650l7WGO PREMISE-Fact 2073 2236 Those choices have been made, but at the same time, now they have a choice around database, and so we think that that's a very good incremental opportunity for us.
ppfpZfTlJc NON-ARG 2274 2288  Thanks, Mark.
