YoNlQ0ncNr CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1139 1250 On the product side, we think of actually three things we are trying to do on a continuous basis in Office 365.
ohmPyltT5j PREMISE-Fact 1251 1401 First, even for the customers who are already on Office 365 at any given licensing level, we focus quite a bit on their increased usage and intensity.
ruLOJcPMAq PREMISE-RealExample 1402 1512 So for example, one of the comments I made in my remarks was, for example, SharePoint with PowerApps and Flow.
sMcTkfdZO6 PREMISE-Fact 1513 1585 That's to us to the best way for us to keep having that recurring value.
_gezKh1Oy7 PREMISE-RealExample 1714 1899 Then things like what we are doing to even go to non-knowledge worker audiences in retail or in manufacturing with some of the things that we're doing with staff scheduling for example.
c5fGFaWfDW PREMISE-Fact 1983 2116 Of course, we have significant more opportunity in small and medium sized businesses, although we have had good healthy growth there.
3A9cNDRYOI PREMISE-Other 2117 2281 I think seat growth will come more from material increases internationally as well as with some of the regulated segments of the market finally moving to the cloud.
OeII9QGSj_ CLAIM-Reformulated 2282 2316 Those are all opportunities ahead.
DhW-FCWCf4 PREMISE-Fact 2317 2421 And then the last one of course is the new value in things like E5 with voice or analytics and security.
bhADOdytGA CLAIM-Reformulated 2422 2527 So all those three dimensions, there will be variability quarter to quarter in terms of what's happening.
MsgbJbtRaL CLAIM-Reformulated 2528 2632 But in terms of our investments in that core product value, it is actually happening on all those three.
xHjqKni0Qg PREMISE-Fact 1586 1713 And so we focus quite a bit on adding additional value even to the existing licensing levels and increasing intensity of usage.
AHPMtEGTkt PREMISE-Fact 1900 1982 That's a way to expand seats even beyond what is the traditional knowledge worker.
Mzw_Uf2Zvi CLAIM-Fact 2646 2814 And to your point on where we are and what's driving that delta and its consistency, frankly, over time, actually still the biggest impact is from the transition to E3.
AVtbpZBaQ6 PREMISE-Fact 3060 3153 But really from an ARPU perspective, the biggest driver continues to be the transition to E3.
U8m8M-xpuR CLAIM-Fact 3154 3307 And so then that leads to your question on do you continue to believe there's some margin expansion possible as you add newer and higher value workloads.
sBvovl5xun CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3308 3458 And of course, the answer to that is we do believe that, but it certainly comes over a period of time and run through our annuity base over that pace.
UzkR7zL9BO CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2901 3059 We're excited about all the customers in trial and are already starting to use the value, whether it's security, increasingly analytics, and ultimately voice.
JE01bJjerD NON-ARG 1120 1125 Yeah.
sZVRwZaIYy NON-ARG 1126 1138 I can start.
rJZlppXsIg PREMISE-Fact 2815 2837 Transitions take time.
KUQFiJE9AO CLAIM-Fact 2838 2900 And so you're just starting to see some of the impact from E5.
rdwCPCihzc NON-ARG 3469 3493  Great, thank you, Phil.
vLeSnznfEv NON-ARG 3494 3531 We'll take the next question, please.
