Rcnh0BZUCa NON-ARG 916 971 I'll just real quickly address the ad load issue, Mark.
9Z951IJRZj NON-ARG 972 1032 Sorry if it wasn't clear, really no change in outlook there.
gVWWLMiKZb CLAIM-Fact 1033 1104 We continue to expect that we'll see deceleration in ad revenue growth.
H7vjPjPZIH PREMISE-Fact 1105 1284 And that's going to be particularly pronounced as we get into the second half of 2017 because ad load will be a less significant factor driving growth starting in the second half.
nXkNDcOSxV CLAIM-Fact 1812 1923 And what we found is that the main reason code was sent back at different rates was not correlated with gender.
6331-fQv2v PREMISE-Fact 1924 2025 It was correlated with level, and the fact that we have more male senior engineers was explaining it.
9dLnD90btm PREMISE-Fact 2026 2118 If you compared male and female engineers at the same level, there was not this discrepancy.
mzB55xszcg NON-ARG 2119 2275 Then that leads to the obvious question is are you promoting men and women at the same rate and the broader question of are you paying men and women fairly.
kxJzsyoVRd NON-ARG 2276 2397 And we do a comprehensive look at that every single promotion and pay and performance cycle we have, which is six months.
CBKLjdi-cz NON-ARG 2398 2469 And we know that we're promoting men and women at the same rate as men.
YXQFqrPW8h NON-ARG 2470 2540 Now that said, our industry still has issues and we still have issues.
df98OsUknG PREMISE-Fact 2541 2586 We don't have enough senior female engineers.
SKpr6DU7df PREMISE-Fact 2587 2642 We don't have enough women going into computer science,
OOmZRRAqtO CLAIM-Fact 2643 2850 and we take this very seriously, from the work we've done with LinkedIn to get CS&E Lean In circles all over college campuses, to encourage more women and under-represented minorities to come into our field.
FbpoMEfdhX PREMISE-Fact 2851 3175 We've had a really nice program in extra internships where we're taking people who are not yet majoring in computer science but we think have the ability, and teaching them for a summer and seeing them return, to the work we're doing with our female engineers to make sure that all forms of bias are surfaced and eliminated.
B4Cjj5Yg9Z NON-ARG 3176 3238 And we can continue to use the full talents of the population.
7QZAIAQwfG NON-ARG 3239 3271 Nothing is more important to us.
0atkUk1mK9 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1307 1463 On the issue you raised with the Facebook female engineers, I'm really glad to have a chance to address this because this is an issue I take very seriously.
s2I7j66u9_ PREMISE-Fact 1464 1573 On the specific report on this study, the study was conducted by a former employee with very incomplete data.
F46BHaUEly PREMISE-Fact 1574 1811 When that study was shared with people internally, and we have that culture where people do studies and share things, and we're really glad because that helps surface issues, we immediately conducted our own research using the full data.
