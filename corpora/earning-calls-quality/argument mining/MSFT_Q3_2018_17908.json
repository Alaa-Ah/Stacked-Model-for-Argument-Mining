Satya, you touched on the synergies that you're seeing between new applications businesses and LinkedIn helping the two out.

So that workflow, we have every layer of it. We have the best deployment tools and development tools in Azure. We have this common data model. On top of this, we have the best BI visualization technology. So that's what you're seeing increasingly as the synergy.
