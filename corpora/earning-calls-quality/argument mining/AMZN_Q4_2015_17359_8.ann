GAlDyjtBcK NON-ARG 919 924 Sure.
j9swyBoj5w NON-ARG 925 987 Let me work backwards from your footprint question or comment.
eqgS6BwqZJ NON-ARG 1137 1173 CapEx, let me start with that first.
ancpTeSoR- CLAIM-Fact 1174 1256 CapEx, we've seen great efficiencies in capital expenditures, particularly in AWS.
u3c7SOZY_m CLAIM-Policy 1257 1363 And we continue to work on better purchase efficiencies and driving utilization rates in our data centers.
7aimiizc4B PREMISE-Statistic 1364 1516 CapEx, as I mentioned, grew quite a bit in 2014 and grew even more to over $9 billion across all of our capital expenditures and capital leases in 2015.
B5aOMM0je7 CLAIM-Fact 1517 1580 From the new regions, they are not the major driver in any way.
j_3Qx6Az4v PREMISE-Fact 1581 1708 Most of our capacity and capital and capital leases in AWS is to service existing regions and existing customers demand growth.
QtWiJEzR5n PREMISE-Fact 1709 1773 But there is certainly expenditures when we open up new regions.
J7f5QRu4nz PREMISE-Fact 1774 1837 Some of that is not always in the year that we open the region.
mYke8UIR1t PREMISE-Fact 1838 1898 So we spent a good bit on those new regions already in 2015.
9vvHlcNMFJ PREMISE-Statistic 1899 2065 But as far as pricing, there's no capacity constraint, and I would a little bit dispute the deceleration comment on, yes, on a percentage basis, 69% is lower than Q3.
acmCnvHwg4 PREMISE-Statistic 2066 2146 But as I said before, we're approaching a $10 billion run rate in this business.
UXb3fGdHyd PREMISE-Fact 2147 2389 On a dollar basis, we continue to grow â€“ we saw the greatest growth year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter and, again, we continue to invent, now with our price, we continue to innovate on behalf of customers and see great customer response.
rVPkmNkXH4 NON-ARG 988 1136 We have - we just announced Korea as a region and we'll be adding five more regions in the next, in the future, in the near future, as we mentioned.
