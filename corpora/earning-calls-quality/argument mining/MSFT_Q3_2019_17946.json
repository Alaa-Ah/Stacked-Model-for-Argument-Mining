Q - Karl Keirstead Amy, I'd like to ask you about the big revenue beat in the Intelligent Cloud segment that drove much of the upside and in particular the server product KPI that was just addressed up 9%. I'm just wondering if you could frame how material the contribution of the Version 2008 upgrades were?

When I think about the on-prem number I really divide it into things that have durable value and things I think of as more one-time.
