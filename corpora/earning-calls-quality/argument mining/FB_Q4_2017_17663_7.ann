oAkh1tp8fi PREMISE-Fact 3157 3288 Today, that whole model is that people can post what they want and then a person can flag it, and then our systems will look at it.
dXbuGwTjMe PREMISE-Fact 3289 3404 But increasingly as we move into the future, we're going to be able to proactively take down some negative content.
