Mark, you talked about maybe trying to accelerate a little bit the messaging monetization end. I'm wondering if there's anything more behind that statement. Is it that you were frustrated with the level that you had seen to date, or that you saw some opportunity that you thought you could accelerate the push towards I guess monetizing? And maybe big picture, I want to ask. I know the monetization is very early stages. It's barely even begun. There's very few platforms around the world that have got 1 billion users that are unmonetized, so you would think that there's a lot of opportunity there, but maybe not. And maybe people are making a mistake in trying to look at Asian assets and seeing what they've done there and thinking that you can do with your asset. So what's the upside? When you think about the real opportunity, what gets you excited about the ability to monetize those assets five years from now?", "start": 105, "labels": ["QUESTION"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 1064, "text": "Mark Elliot Zuckerberg", "start": 1041, "labels": ["REPRESENTATIVE"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 3249, "text": ": Sure. So we're currently going through the process of figuring out what we want to invest in over the next year and doing our long-range planning, and this is certainly one of the areas where I think we want to be investing a lot more in and believe that there's a big opportunity and can accelerate all the effort. I do think, as you say, this is one of the rare times in business where you can look at messaging platforms that exist and see how they've successfully monetized in other parts of the world and have that be a floor. I think that over time, we should be able to do better, but that at least provides this existence proof that despite \u2013 regardless of what our internal logic is of what we're doing, that someone has done it. So that gives us some degree of confidence there in addition to our own execution on other things. But I feel there's a pretty clear playbook that we have here of first building up the consumer usage, then building up the organic person-to-business interaction, making sure it works for both people and businesses. And then once you have that, the quality of those interactions is really what contributes to the scale of how much you can grow. We've seen this in News Feed too. One of the factors that's contributed to ad load over time is the quality of the ads. If ad quality was low, we wouldn't be able to put as many ads in because people wouldn't want them. But in a lot of markets around the world, we see that ad quality is increasing at a very fast rate, and that makes it so that a lot of times people do ask for the content, which of course creates a very different dynamic. So we need to get to that in messaging. And because messaging really started from the place of people communicating one to one with each other and is now adding all these other uses, it's just a lot of investment and a lot of different functionality that needs to get added. But for all the reasons that I've said here around our own experience doing this in other contexts with Facebook and Instagram, proof points in the market of how it's worked, I think over the long term I'm pretty confident that we will get there, and it's our job to just go do that.", "start": 1065, "labels": ["ANSWER"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 3265, "text": "David M.
