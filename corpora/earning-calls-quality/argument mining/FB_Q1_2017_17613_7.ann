36vNHmZ5Zp PREMISE-Fact 1360 1454 On TV, we are definitely seeing people continue to advertise on TV and use us as a complement.
0Vei6uQpTx CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1455 1649 So over time, we believe that the dollar shifts with eyeballs and we want to earn it from our clients and be the best dollar and the best minute they spend and help them measure across channels.
Pmt39F5KVJ NON-ARG 1650 1756 I think increasingly, the question is not if you can do without TV, but it's if you can do without mobile.
o_gNUZElGe CLAIM-Fact 1757 1855 And we're working hard to help advertisers develop the video creative that really works for mobile
x6JiD30_BO PREMISE-Fact 1856 1906 because that really makes a really big difference.
rJJb_GJ_Lq CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1907 2045 And we think the combination of the creative working for mobile but also the measurement and targeting we can do is a very powerful offer.
SrjDuz1vSr PREMISE-RealExample 2046 2234 To share one of my favorite new examples, Subway working with their agency 360i developed video ads and images for Facebook and Instagram to promote the limited time offer Reuben sandwich.
awgorF8aA3 PREMISE-Fact 2235 2373 And they used Audience Insights, targeting people ages 18 to 49 who purchase meat and cheese, and that's just pretty incredible targeting.
4AULgMeh9v NON-ARG 2374 2505 Nowhere else I don't think you can actually target that way and people interested in fast food and encourage them to visit Subways.
hQLppECz_7 PREMISE-RealExample 2506 2642 They then used Nielsen Brand Effects and were able to measure a 16-point lift in ad recall and a 5-point lift in intent to visit Subway.
RQT2T_ZLy2 CLAIM-Reformulated 2643 2803 So it's a really unique combination of the power of creative that was designed for video for mobile with very specific targeting and very specific measurements.
OjXikMxMBw NON-ARG 612 624 Sure, Colin.
VGlyyOarjS NON-ARG 625 650 I'll take that first one.
QYMrpvXBg2 NON-ARG 651 751 So impression growth was 32% in Q1, as I noted, and that was a bit slower than in previous quarters.
ssruOY8Aqs PREMISE-Fact 752 902 Those of you who have been following us for a while know that periodically we make changes to the product that is going to impact some of the metrics.
4pGAlZeCNP PREMISE-Fact 903 1067 One of the things that I would call out in Q1 as a contributing factor on the impression growth side was our decision to rank longer-form video higher in News Feed.
Qgb4SFUjlr PREMISE-Fact 1068 1172 That means more time in video, and that does come at the expense of some impression growth in News Feed.
-Kh5VICAmn CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1173 1272 So I think you do see some interplay there on the impression growth side due to our focus on video.
EQ6Xh76sMw NON-ARG 1273 1337 And then Sheryl was going to follow up on the video ad spending.
