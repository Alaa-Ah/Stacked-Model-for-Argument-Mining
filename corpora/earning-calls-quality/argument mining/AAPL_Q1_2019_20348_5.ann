IsnjvDswlZ NON-ARG 636 641 Yeah.
tvSJhzSHSH NON-ARG 642 671 I mean three questions there.
ItnUCbfbNw NON-ARG 672 720 The first one is a question around conservatism.
4UfI0gH_pL NON-ARG 1959 2086 On the positive side, we expect that we will continue to grow revenue nicely from the rest of the business which is not iPhone.
u9UOs9RnJ6 CLAIM-Fact 2869 2923 We do design our products to last as long as possible.
eFpkOFf_4o CLAIM-Opinion(view) 721 818 As we always do when we provide a range, it's a range that we believe we're going to fall within.
W-SCwc5Qte PREMISE-Fact 819 889 We've done pretty well with that up until the December quarter, right?
WWO8g7LIca CLAIM-Reformulated 946 965 So that's the idea.
fy8QP8PLUw CLAIM-Opinion(view) 966 1011 There isn't a specific level of conservatism.
TSTZhLx8ia CLAIM-Reformulated 1012 1079 We believe that this is the range where we're going to fall within.
Szdh-jkDLs NON-ARG 890 945 I mean, we've been â€“ we didn't miss in years and years.
wSijy9YfqW NON-ARG 1080 1234 On channel inventory, as you know our historical pattern for iPhone channel inventory is that typically we increase inventory in Q1 and we decrease in Q2.
oc1T0w0WiI NON-ARG 1235 1366 And we think this year will be similar and we've exited the December quarter with levels of inventory that we are comfortable with.
W_LbaP70iL NON-ARG 1367 1476 So that leaves us with the reality that our iPhone performance in Q1 from a revenue standpoint was minus 15%.
IowulrhZkL NON-ARG 1477 1662 And we expect that the key factors that Tim mentioned during the call affecting iPhone performance in Q1 will also have an effect on Q2 starting with the strong U.S. dollar environment.
ZoUhu3rSuo NON-ARG 1663 1864 On a year-over-year basis, the negative impact from currency is going to be about $1.3 billion, so that's about a bit more than two points versus last year's revenue and so that obviously plays a role.
EVmn9vvQgQ NON-ARG 1865 1958 And the macroeconomic environment particularly in emerging markets will continue to be there.
9DlXRJLLd7 PREMISE-Fact 2924 3010 Some people hold onto those for the life of the product and some people trade them in.
Y434eq5chj PREMISE-Fact 3011 3069 And then that phone is then redistributed to someone else.
AYeRx1erH6 CLAIM-Reformulated 3182 3210 There's no doubt about that.
T5JKt4JJAv CLAIM-Fact 3136 3181 The cycles -- the average cycle has extended.
XH6ZyCHVrV NON-ARG 3386 3432 So, where it goes in the future, I don't know,
Fpx8tmBIOA CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3433 3566 but I'm convinced that making a great product that is high quality, that is the best thing for the customer and we work for the user.
mRaysyauyK NON-ARG 3211 3385 We've said several times I think on this call and before, that the upgrades for the quarter were less than we anticipated due to the -- all the reasons that we had mentioned.
S4dW7H7EnR NON-ARG 3070 3135 And so it doesn't necessarily follow that one leads to the other.
JMyX9dn2NG NON-ARG 3567 3607 And so that's the way that we look at it
mfKAbNlXIC NON-ARG 3622 3639  Thank you, Toni.
