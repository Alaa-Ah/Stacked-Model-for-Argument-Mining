VJe5fHHzjr PREMISE-Statistic 2320 2428 And I think as Luca said earlier, when you change that for an average weekly sales basis, it’s actually 22%.
CeEIsn_yEj CLAIM-Fact 2429 2472 And so it was a stellar quarter for iPhone.

wjApo9pRmM PREMISE-Fact 2817 2874 And that is even through today, actually through January.
fWEvHvLEpi CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2875 2918 And so we feel fantastic about the results.
-xXGJMSrI1 PREMISE-Fact 3073 3354 We think about the advances in technology that were a part of the iPhone X from -- we went from Touch ID to Face ID; Face ID has been incredibly well received; the wireless charging, the edge to edge super retina display; and totally new gestures, the user experience is different.
FiZJR8iqos CLAIM-Fact 3355 3402 And so it’s great to get that kind of feedback.
ZdIEfO4186 NON-ARG 3403 3493 If you look at the the overall iPhone line to get to the essence of the question, I think.
zRQFGb-m4w NON-ARG 3494 3576 I looked -- I reviewed the top many markets, I’ll talk briefly about the top four.
taaNYlcasr PREMISE-Statistic 3577 3661 In Urban China and the U.S., the top five smartphones last quarter were all iPhones.
z20MUVCUIe PREMISE-Statistic 3662 3721 And in Japan and the UK, six of the top seven were iPhones.
cd7ohJRuQu NON-ARG 3722 3859 And so in a market that is as large as the smartphone market is, people want some level of choice and they’re deciding which ones to buy.
ZDCLxAdn3y CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3860 3923 But we feel fantastic, particularly as it pertains to iPhone X.
qUjkq5S6Ya CLAIM-Fact 2919 3005 The most important thing for us is that really the number, it’s customer satisfaction.
KMx3oSDO9G PREMISE-Fact 3006 3072 And customer satisfaction is literally off the charts on iPhone X.
r8c-9k0nvv CLAIM-Opinion(view) 600 743 Of course, we've been talking about the importance of tax reform over the years, because we believe it's really beneficial to the U.S. economy.

jnVqEwRblp PREMISE-Fact 874 1012 And in the past, we've been addressing this issue by having to raise debt as the cash was overseas; the majority of the cash was overseas.
4VwXeL3DuR PREMISE-Statistic 1013 1143 And so we are now in a position where we have $285 billion of cash, we've got $122 billion of debt for a net cash of $163 billion.
NxYbqhfnXm CLAIM-Reformulated 1144 1195 We have now the flexibility to deploy this capital.
