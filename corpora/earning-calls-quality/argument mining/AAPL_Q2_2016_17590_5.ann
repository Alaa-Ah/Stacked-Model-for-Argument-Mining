JGpFyloJr4 CLAIM-Fact 665 745 The vast majority of the weakness in the Greater China region sits in Hong Kong.
WKoUzCfDCg NON-ARG 484 517 Shannon, thanks for the question.
QXaWkhfLjt NON-ARG 518 664 If you take Greater China, we include Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mainland China in the Greater China segment that you see reported on your data sheet.
VQfEC9MKYM PREMISE-Fact 746 924 And our perspective on that is it's a combination of the Hong Kong dollar being pegged to the U.S. dollar, and therefore it carries the burden of the strength of the U.S. dollar.
sDixP3sX8A PREMISE-Fact 925 1049 And that has driven tourism, international shopping, and trading down significantly compared to what it was in the year ago.
xgeUcqlvqz CLAIM-Reformulated 1981 2139 And so we continue to be really optimistic about it and just would ask folks to look underneath the numbers at the details of them before concluding anything.
MptQVLcVdI CLAIM-Reformulated 2140 2164 Thanks for the question.
Oz6ny9nOQn CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1703 1747 And so we remain really optimistic on China.
HAycnXFG5_ PREMISE-Other 1815 1897 We'll open five more this quarter to achieve 40, which we had talked about before.
qeyD_1yTtO PREMISE-Fact 1898 1980 And the LTE adoption continues to rise there, but it's got a long way ahead of it.
vEgume19YM CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1450 1563 And so as I back up from this and look at the larger picture, I think China is not weak as has been talked about.
IIuiJwNoih CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1564 1702 I see China as may not have the wind at our backs that we once did, but it's a lot more stable than what I think is the common view of it.
X5AkY__UlK PREMISE-Statistic 1329 1374 And if you look at it there, we were down 5%.
9NWBY_SWgW PREMISE-Statistic 1375 1449 And keep in mind that that's down 5% on a comp a year ago that was up 81%.
cFNOFhzYBC PREMISE-Other 1237 1328 And the way that we really look at the health or underlying demand is look at sell-through.
wPWv7sf5hC PREMISE-Statistic 1050 1186 If you look at Mainland China, which is one that I am personally very focused on, we are down 11% in Mainland China on a reported basis.
6TV2vGAxLI PREMISE-Statistic 1187 1236 On a constant currency basis, we're only down 7%.
tpdcin_oey CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3313 3406 And so that part we really need to protect and we want to continue to invest in the business.
fCmmgTKaXP PREMISE-Fact 3176 3312 We do much more in-house technology development than we used to do a few years ago, which we think is a great investment for us to make.
KFsCokMMWx PREMISE-Fact 3121 3175 We have a much broader portfolio than we used to have.
joH_5zWGHd PREMISE-Fact 3053 3120 We continue to invest in initiatives and projects ahead of revenue.
XgonAsANQN NON-ARG 2615 2634 Shannon, it's Luca.
oRdTEHfhSC NON-ARG 2635 2663 Of course we think about it.
APSRfPIVIb NON-ARG 2664 2688 We think about it a lot.
ihvCDXQwvi NON-ARG 2689 2850 And so when you look at our results, for example, our OpEx for the quarter, for the March quarter was up 10%, which is the lowest rate that you've seen in years.
XIggiBEbRo NON-ARG 2851 2922 And when you look within OpEx, you actually see two different dynamics.
GPe3KwE7dQ PREMISE-Fact 2923 3052 You see continued significant investments in research and development because we really believe that's the future of the company.
CHiWlGrCYq NON-ARG 3407 3511 And then when you look at our SG&A portion of OpEx for the March quarter, it was actually down slightly.
vSXzROYJaA NON-ARG 3512 3621 So obviously, we think about it, and of course we look at our revenue trend and we take measures accordingly.
Eb0l9fIee6 NON-ARG 3622 3810 And when you look at the guidance that we provided for the June quarter, that 10% year-over-year increase that I mentioned to you for the March quarter goes down to a range of 7% to 9% up.
LZAf1wdvNH CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3811 3939 And again, the focus is on making investments in R&D and continuing to run SG&A extremely tightly and in a very disciplined way.
IwoPfgw7pe PREMISE-Statistic 3940 4005 As you know, our E-to-R, expense-to-revenue ratio, is around 10%.
9pBHN1IvLC PREMISE-Other 4006 4046 It's something that we're very proud of.
kxC2NotoYj PREMISE-Other 4047 4153 It's a number that is incredibly competitive in our industry, and we want to continue to keep it that way.
gXjYX563jN PREMISE-Other 4154 4217 At the same time, we don't want to underinvest in the business.
P5artZMOeA PREMISE-Statistic 1748 1796 We opened seven stores there during the quarter.
GSEGBrBffs PREMISE-Statistic 1797 1814 We now are at 35.
aUDHLYxFKP NON-ARG 86 107  Thank you very much.
cOzNwXEszx NON-ARG 108 134 I have a couple questions.
LqvmfwPogx NON-ARG 135 195 One, Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China?
SpDHsgqUAB NON-ARG 196 250 I know the Greater China revenue I think was down 26%.
ODkBvlNpvD NON-ARG 251 285 You did talk about Mainland China.
oHIZrNqeqS NON-ARG 286 462 But just if you could, talk about some of the trends you're seeing there and how you think it's playing out, and maybe your thoughts on iPhone SE adoption within China as well.
GQzxQSfMbk NON-ARG 2182 2196  Okay, thanks.
pdsFhvYxkJ NON-ARG 2197 2375 And then my second question is with regard to OpEx leverage or thinking about when I look at the revenue, your revenue is below our expectations, but OpEx is pretty much in line.
EzThxQfELq NON-ARG 2376 2515 So how are you thinking about potential for leverage, I don't know, cost containment maybe when macro is bad and revenue is under pressure?
TXixWjmNhj NON-ARG 2516 2600 And how are you juggling that versus the required investment you need to go forward?
jpbpEZJsSP NON-ARG 4235 4246  Thank you.
