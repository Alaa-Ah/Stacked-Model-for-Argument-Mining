mxumPxk0Ql CLAIM-Opinion(view) 649 770 And so the growth is actually quite good underneath that and that’s obviously a problem with everyone struggling with it.
0cJlFor3nL PREMISE-Other 475 531 You have to consider the constant currency growth rates.
RQB--lfrUe PREMISE-Statistic 532 648 And so if you do that, our guidance is actually 8% to 11% because we have about a 700 basis point FX headwind in Q1.
z6P5yYUdoj NON-ARG 771 852 Zooming out to the more macro question about growth, here’s what I see currently.
Q29FNtjbaQ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 853 1042 We believe that iPhone will grow in Q1 and we base that on what we are seeing from a switcher point of view, we recorded the highest rate on record for Android switches last quarter at 30%.
z60WtRRlZ_ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1208 1265 So we feel like we have a very open field in front of us.
zxpwUMMpJp PREMISE-Statistic 1162 1207 And that number is in the low 30 percentages.
PDWqc3BCK- PREMISE-Fact 1043 1161 We also look at the number of people that have upgraded, that were in the installed base prior to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.
UJAao5PJ_F PREMISE-RealExample 2007 2109 I was really impressed last quarter with our progress in Vietnam and Indonesia and India among others.
oqNhWGFQ8_ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1266 1430 Our performance in emerging markets although it’s quite good and our revenue was good our market share is low and the LTE penetration in these markets is quite low.
9CY6YRGseN CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1431 1596 Also, if I zoom out and look at China, as I have said before and just to make the point once again is we see an enormous change in China over the next several years.
D5J8lUTXWw PREMISE-Other 1597 1734 The latest study I have seen from Mackenzie indicates if you look back five years China’s middle class had about 50 million people in it.
c7P6ylZEKK PREMISE-Other 1735 1806 If you look ahead five years, it will have ten times that number in it.
ZzlkWyj3I5 CLAIM-Fact 1948 2006 It’s not the only market that we are working on obviously.
Krzcc-6pGn NON-ARG 3000 3050 Long answer but I thought you might be interested.
tkwBRTOu1z CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2940 2999 So sort of everywhere I look I see significant opportunity.
x7uhHeENEg CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1807 1947 And so -- and I feel like we are reasonably well positioned in China, I’m sure we can do better, but I think we are doing fairly well there.
K-skNouELy CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2663 2727 And finally, the enterprise business is not to be underestimated
KSZ338S768 PREMISE-Statistic 2729 2846 I doubt very many people knew that we had $25 billion enterprise business that we quietly built in not too many years
X6p1CeYsN1 PREMISE-Fact 2848 2875 but our penetration is low,
5wSjjCqh2U PREMISE-Fact 2876 2939 but we have significant actions going on to really deepen that.
qVvS4jHqmF PREMISE-RealExample 2359 2413 In addition to those Apple TV is off to a great start.
5_hO5zkal3 PREMISE-RealExample 2449 2545 The app store hit a new record again last quarter and the growth seems to be really great there.
qMinSL047F PREMISE-RealExample 2546 2661 I’m really happy with the early days of Apple Music and the people moving from the free trial to the music business
6LitFN1NDf PREMISE-RealExample 2414 2448 Apple Watch is just getting going.
PY-ZRDpRcB CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2110 2209 Also, from the currency point of view and the weak global economies, we don’t overly focus on this.
6u_-5OlHui CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2210 2358 It’s - my view is that it’s sort of a transitional kind of thing and we invest for the long term, so we are continuing to invest for Apple’s future.
F8vQX0SKhf CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3557 3591 That's become a sizeable business.
ixvYP0yuHw PREMISE-Statistic 3453 3519 Well, the App Store is growing over 20%, it grew 25% last quarter,
s5iE-0JkoA CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3520 3556 and so we feel very good about that.
_ZFYwVx-JU CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3770 4048 And so we think that in the aggregate that they may reduce upgrade cycles and also the iPhone that has been sold to someone else hits the price point that we're not hitting today largely which could help further fuel the services revenue which we did quite well on last quarter.
Bi3c_33uhl PREMISE-Other 3592 3769 I would also point out that some of these upgrade programs that are in the market, they sort of began to look more like a subscription business in terms of the way they operate.
DVIfmWYoFK NON-ARG 458 475  Katy, it’s Tim.
