lmcO2f0ZCb NON-ARG 543 554 Sure, yeah.
kv_r0xm7GA NON-ARG 555 570 Thanks, Justin.
5xnFWaL6KX CLAIM-Fact 571 621 Yeah, for the quarter, so it was a strong quarter.
Ybw4WdwLqt PREMISE-Statistic 720 804 AWS had its third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, 49% FX-neutral growth.
c-JvDeXKo6 PREMISE-Fact 805 840 Advertising also had strong growth.
BdlIKQW_7f PREMISE-Fact 841 979 Elsewhere we saw probably better than expected efficiencies in operations, our infrastructure costs, and generally all of our fixed costs.
8TTrvkafhl NON-ARG 1362 1394 So that's what I would point to.
sahSNFzNIz CLAIM-Fact 1704 1923 Even while in International, we're continuing to invest in a lot of areas, we continue to frontload Prime benefits for the newer geographies, we continue to launch new countries as we launch Prime in Australia recently.
I0O2lKkB38 PREMISE-RealExample 1924 2009 We've launched devices in multiple countries, Echo and Alexa were launched in France.
LRNt_G8UYF PREMISE-RealExample 2010 2072 Echo Spot was launched in India and Japan in the last quarter.
mZf0t1VsHi CLAIM-Reformulated 2073 2191 So continued – it's a mix of operating efficiencies as we grow, and then also continuing to invest on a lot of fronts.
1Y8mLvpl-_ CLAIM-Fact 1444 1703 I would say that, in addition to the operating efficiencies, advertising is also starting to make an impact on gross profit, although advertising is smaller in International segment than it's in North America, it's growing at a same rapid clip year-over-year.
t3fK5WyGm_ PREMISE-Statistic 980 1361 You'll note that in the first half of the year capital leases were flat year-over-year, although we're up 20% for the full trailing 12 months, in the last 6 months it's been pretty flat as the team has really worked well to plan our data centers run our data centers more efficiently, even to meet again increasing usage at our customers; usage rates are exceeding our growth rate.
p7kImw-r5R CLAIM-Fact 622 719 We had – what I attribute it to is continued strength in our – some of our most profitable areas.
NHOQELNgtS CLAIM-Fact 1395 1443 Internationally, a lot of the same factors hold.
