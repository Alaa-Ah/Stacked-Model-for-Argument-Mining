So, Coca-Cola used that in Kenya and Nigeria. They took screenshots of a video ad they have produced for other markets, they uploaded them with text; and they reached 2 million people with a 10-point lift in ad awareness. So, the way we need to drive sales around the world is by understanding markets, launching things like click to missed call ads in India and making sure our products work for market but also being able to connect to those advertising metrics and business metrics around the world. Video ads are important on our platform and the most important thing that\u2019s growing well there is consumer engagement with video is growing. We have 500 million people watching video a day. And the fact that so much video is being consumed on our platform gives us room for an ads business to grow because we want the formats to match.

The video ad spend is not all incremental of course because every time we put an ad in newsfeed, if it\u2019s a video ad, it\u2019s taking a place of an ad with another format. In terms of learnings, one of the most important learnings we have is that video formats are different on Facebook. There\u2019re certainly people that are watching the whole 30-second video ad with sound, but there are some people that are doing at less, they\u2019re watching shorter formats and they\u2019re watching with sound.
