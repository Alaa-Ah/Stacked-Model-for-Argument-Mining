5l_Y6xX9p5 NON-ARG 791 823 Let me circle back on Prime Day.
8OsnwF-xaR PREMISE-Statistic 824 948 So again, it was the biggest global day ever for Amazon and was up 60% on a order product sales basis versus Prime Day 2015.
XVtNA6wK6Z CLAIM-Fact 949 988 It was a record day for Amazon devices.
ERGR0WHZW7 PREMISE-Fact 1562 1766 And on the stock-based compensation, you'll recall beginning in Q1 this year, we began allocating stock-based compensation and other operating expense to our North America, international and AWS segments.
Ap5a3sPTkU CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1767 1916 So we're including that in our guidance on operating income and have not separately guided to stock-based comp and other income expense this quarter.
hdYVAa-q8z PREMISE-Fact 989 1092 It was a great day for small businesses and sellers who saw great year-over improvement in their sales.
WnouHDTuAo CLAIM-Fact 1093 1148 And more importantly, it was a great day for customers.
pO8i7SMXA1 PREMISE-Fact 1149 1219 Globally they saved over double what they had saved in Prime Day 2015.
XPptwq0-BQ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1220 1332 So we're very pleased with the results of Prime Day, and the impact of Prime Day is factored into this guidance.
74hME0rreR CLAIM-Reformulated 1333 1547 As far as new customers and new Prime members, we're not disclosing that, but suffice to say that it was a great day for both existing Prime members and also new customers who were trying us out for the first time.
