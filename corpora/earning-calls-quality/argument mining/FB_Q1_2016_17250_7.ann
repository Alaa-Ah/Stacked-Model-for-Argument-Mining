IeIq-coT6E NON-ARG 688 715 Thank you for the question.
4fT_k10_EW NON-ARG 716 840 SMBs, or SMUs as they're called in different places around the world, we think are a very core competitive advantage for us.
lPrx3u_UTQ NON-ARG 841 922 It's prohibitively expensive for most small businesses to reach people digitally.
Fz29zodVsc NON-ARG 923 1059 Thirty-five percent of small businesses in the United States, which is often the most advanced market, don't have a web presence at all.
AijKPxtD4O PREMISE-Fact 1060 1166 And setting up a mobile app, getting people to find and download a mobile app, can be even more expensive.
cCX7A0YoLK CLAIM-Fact 1167 1259 And so what's happening is that SMBs are turning to Facebook pages as their mobile solution.
Q3Gv48j350 PREMISE-Fact 1260 1408 They're free, they're easy to set up, and they already know how to do them because almost all of them are already Facebook users in the first place.
eS9ss4N-u9 CLAIM-Fact 1409 1486 And so the onboarding has been incredibly important and incredibly effective.
NhrfY2au2f PREMISE-Statistic 1487 1586 We announced last year that we have over 50 million small business pages active on a monthly basis.
UwLEWWLBKz PREMISE-Statistic 1587 1632 Eighty percent of those are active on mobile.
tTZRGMLFSq PREMISE-Statistic 1633 1839 We then work on helping them use our ad products and upsell them to our paid ad products as well, and we announced this quarter that we hit 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and 200,000 on Instagram.
Tx7O367sIs CLAIM-Fact 1840 1956 What's interesting is that what you see is SMBs are able to use the pull of some of the biggest brands in the world.
73JumIn9Ww PREMISE-Statistic 1957 2042 So over 2 million SMBs have posted a video, both paid and organic, in the last month.
2UCq2NwKT1 PREMISE-Fact 2043 2137 And that happens to be many times the number of SMBs that have shot or placed a TV commercial.
PYG7xMehaq PREMISE-Fact 2138 2270 In terms of measurement, your question is important because it's not just getting them to use our platforms to connect to consumers.
WcyCUkPWsn PREMISE-Fact 2271 2323 It's getting them to be able to measure our results.
PwmKHvnfG9 CLAIM-Fact 2324 2488 And so we've worked hard to build measurement tools into the products, so that when you buy an ad, an SMB has a very easy interface and decide what their goals are.
sMzrwGNHeS NON-ARG 2489 2521 Are their goals measuring sales?
qAxfOYPgfJ NON-ARG 2522 2562 Are their goals clicks to their website?
kTDQqDvXwK NON-ARG 2563 2600 Are their goals mobile app downloads?
GwleRLGyTA NON-ARG 2601 2677 And then measuring all the way through from sharing that ad to the purchase.
NJWvENGjZQ CLAIM-Other 2678 2739 I continue and we continue to be very bullish on this channel
ywOOV8SYKn PREMISE-Fact 2740 2783 because we have such a broad base of usage,
7Zi2NjF_Ke PREMISE-Fact 2784 2816 because that usage is so active,
v3jgwIj9hS PREMISE-Fact 2817 2919 and because we're very focused on investing in simplifying our products so that all SMBs can use them.
