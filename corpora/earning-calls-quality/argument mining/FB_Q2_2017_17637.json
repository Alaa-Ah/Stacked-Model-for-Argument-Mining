We've talked a lot, obviously, already about ad impression growth and how it's set to slow in the second half. You're already seeing a big slowdown in impression growth in the first half.

So, there have been a number of questions about Messenger. And in general, we're seeing \u2013 I'm happy with the rate of growth in the experiences that we're seeing on Messenger. But if there's one message here that I think is actually important to say, it's that we're trying to communicate that the pace of growing the Messenger business, it's a longer-term thing. I actually think over the next couple of years or few years, the much bigger driver of the business and determinant of how we do is going to be video, not Messenger. Messenger, I think, is a really important thing and WhatsApp over a three- to five-year period, and we're investing a lot in it. I think it's a huge opportunity. But as has been noted on the call, video is both at large scale and the economics are quite different from the current feed-based businesses that we have today, especially around how, with mid-roll ads and rev share around that, the margin structure will be different. So, I mean, one of the big questions that we're focused on as we build this out, we're very committed to building it out because it's what people in the community want. But one of the big things that we're really very focused on is making sure that we get this right so that even though this business will likely be \u2013 not likely, I think almost certainly will be a lower margin source of revenue than the current thing that we do, there's this big question of how incremental is that behavior going to be. And I'm just throwing this context out there because so many of the questions here today have been about Messenger, and I want to make sure on these calls that we do an accurate and a full job of conveying what we're actually thinking about as a business and what we think the outlook is going to be. And I think that those questions around video, which I'm optimistic about, but there are real questions there that we need to manage well, is going to be a much bigger driver of the business over the next two to three years likely even than the trajectory of what we're doing on Messenger and WhatsApp.", "start": 905, "labels": ["ANSWER"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 3007, "text": "David M.
