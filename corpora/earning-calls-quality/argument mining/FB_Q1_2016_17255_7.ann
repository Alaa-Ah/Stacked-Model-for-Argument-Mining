o7QbogL-fU NON-ARG 606 651 All right, let's talk about engagement first.
gPcmA2RJMW CLAIM-Fact 652 769 So overall sharing is up across Facebook, and people are spending more time on Facebook and the whole family of apps.
D33cbHsNIV PREMISE-Fact 770 974 And that is not just the case for the aggregate of the growing community, but it's actually also the case on a per-person basis as well in terms of people sharing more and spending more time individually.
ctxeCC0PRb CLAIM-Fact 975 1128 Now one of the things that we see is that the way that we are sharing is always changing, and some of this is because of underlying technical transition.
mM1gjO3yTm PREMISE-Fact 1129 1204 So on desktop, for example, it's easier to type, so we saw more text posts.
lGq8IW4A_d PREMISE-Fact 1205 1266 On mobile, it's easier to take videos, so we see more videos.
-WGJTRu-l2 PREMISE-Fact 1267 1518 On desktop, people would have more commonly uploaded an album of photos that they took from their digital camera and downloaded onto their computer; whereas on mobile, the more common behavior is to take a single photo or a couple and just post those.
rT5KPpmCKW CLAIM-Reformulated 1519 1554 So there are all these transitions.
r9NFYlxY6K PREMISE-Fact 1555 1706 And that's our job, is to make it so that we build great tools that people â€“ everyone around the world can share anything that they want with everyone.
TZ_kudBSqk PREMISE-Fact 1707 1815 Now the other thing that's also true is that people want to share with lots of different kinds of audiences.
2oC_OX74Yq CLAIM-Fact 1816 1925 So Facebook gives you the ability to share with all of your friends and publicly if you want and with groups.
3NsVQReqQe CLAIM-Fact 1926 1988 But we're also investing in things like Messenger and WhatsApp
9GLsYtP5mO PREMISE-Fact 1989 2096 because a lot of people want to share increasingly messages privately one on one or with very small groups.
hTaeyUqGZM NON-ARG 3059 3064 Sure.
VVTKEuTJmZ NON-ARG 3065 3188 I guess, also, Justin, you had a question on ad load, so I'll do both the ad load and the question on the reclassification.
uUd0CCCW-N CLAIM-Fact 3189 3262 So on ad load, it's definitely up from where we were couple of years ago.
yieXWnnUBd PREMISE-Fact 3263 3496 I think it's really worth emphasizing that what has enabled us to do that is just improving the quality and the relevance of the ads that we have, and that's enabled us to show more of them without harming the user experience at all.
_A_rezG6q4 NON-ARG 3497 3523 So that's been really key.
LkWtH8gX9A PREMISE-Fact 3524 3830 Over time, we would expect that ad load growth will be a less significant factor driving overall revenue growth, but we remain confident that we've got opportunities to continue to grow supply through the continued growth in people and engagement on Facebook as well as on our other apps such as Instagram.
31JXD-iS0M NON-ARG 3831 4072 On the question regarding what would happen to Mark's shares if he were to leave Facebook, I'd just refer that the new multi-class capital structure is generally dependent on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook.
r_bW7ttZBa NON-ARG 4073 4207 And if you go into the proxy materials, it goes into more detail on how different things would play out under various other scenarios.
7eaGg282sF NON-ARG 4208 4243 So I would just refer you to those.
R1JuD3otva CLAIM-Value 2097 2408 So in addition to Messenger, which is at 900 million people a month, and WhatsApp, which is at more than 1 billion people a month, Facebook Groups is also at more than 1 billion people a month, which I think represents the increasing diversity of the different types of audiences that people want to share with.
arkKld4jNB CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2409 2644 But ultimately, I think that humans have such a deep desire to express themselves and want to connect with the people around them that I think that all of these audiences and all of these different types of media should grow over time.
suyW7NaLB7 NON-ARG 2645 2834 And it's our job to basically make sure that we build good products and get rid of all the bugs and make it so the performance is fast, and all the basic stuff works, that way we get there.
DDQhoQurap NON-ARG 2835 2916 But in general, right now all the high-level trends look pretty positive on that.
s6P4tepbnf NON-ARG 2917 3041 I think I'll kick it off to Dave to go through your questions about some of the technical pieces about the reclassification.
