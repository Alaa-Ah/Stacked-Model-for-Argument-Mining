7Ome1VNxZa NON-ARG 712 750 Yes, I can start with the stats, Mark.
-o-NhtEsTu CLAIM-Fact 751 885 On the engagement front, we're seeing time spent growth per DAU across the Facebook family of apps, and that includes Facebook itself.
IV2prZlgci PREMISE-Fact 886 954 Instagram has been strong, especially with Feed Ranking and Stories.
ETeqLEEBIy NON-ARG 955 1034 We're not breaking out specific time spent stats on a quarterly basis on those.
PchePAbgOi NON-ARG 1035 1083 And then on the Messenger monetization front...?
KDPGF4yIj1 NON-ARG 1108 1138 I can talk about the strategy.
TUkO-nWiTe NON-ARG 706 710 Sure
Uf14cjSrBj NON-ARG 651 688 Can you start with the stats, Wehner?
sOlLBfNgDI CLAIM-Policy 1139 1559 The first thing that we need to do on Messenger and WhatsApp is get a lot of businesses using it organically and build the behavior for people that they reach out to businesses for different things, like customer support or for getting news content, things that may not eventually be the big business use cases but establish the behavior of people interacting not only with their close friends, but also with businesses.
LGo1hFyvO3 PREMISE-Fact 1977 2055 They can have a better dialogue with the person and a persistent relationship.
VA5cnb9bTK CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1560 1694 In terms of making money on that, once we have that behavior, I think there are going to be a number of ways that we can amplify that.
bquIyIyKE5 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1695 1737 We're already experimenting with a couple.
uoBU4pAvbY CLAIM-Reformulated 2407 2618 And once we get that to a big base, then there are going to be a lot of opportunities to build a business, and the business will be proportional to the amount of that activity that people want to do organically.
yuHzxYP-eF CLAIM-Fact 2260 2406 But the top priority right now is just building out the base of organic interaction between people and businesses that they want to interact with.
3wnTvBxj06 CLAIM-Fact 1738 1919 One is ads that actually display a News Feed, not in Messenger or WhatsApp, but that link to the ability to communicate with a business directly in Messenger or eventually WhatsApp.
9PWakaVQbM CLAIM-Fact 1920 1976 And that's great, it converts better for the businesses.
fzpgMz3D-r CLAIM-Reformulated 2056 2114 So that's one way that I think that this will be valuable.
3iYejH9pZw CLAIM-Fact 2115 2259 The other way is of course eventually showing paid content in Messenger, whether that's in the inbox or in relevant ways throughout the product.
