3xRbEHEXHR NON-ARG 3663 3705 Then, Ben, you asked about shipping units.
r7ebOhGVwa PREMISE-Fact 3706 3749 We did begin shipping units in the quarter.
SVKNT2eLUX PREMISE-Fact 3750 3775 This is very small still.
zHcItmAfRj PREMISE-Fact 3776 3799 VR is still very early.
VQ4M_pyaOE CLAIM-Fact 3800 3860 It's not going to have a material impact on revenue in 2016,
onr3J0gF-B NON-ARG 3861 3914 and I gave more color on that in my prepared remarks.
YvQhO8Zt1d NON-ARG 2165 2222 You asked a question about virtual and augmented reality.
2shcD4YjMf NON-ARG 2223 2262 What are going to be the big use cases?
NnpqodhLcS CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2263 2361 For the first few years of virtual reality, I think gaming and video are going to be the big ones.
TDCwHQtRm9 PREMISE-RealExample 2362 2609 The initial market that we look at are all the people who have Xboxes, PlayStations, and Wiis, the people who are excited to have an immersive media experience sitting in their living room for a long period of time, and that's a pretty big market.
xkWW0VUlst NON-ARG 2610 2873 Even though that's not all of what we hope to eventually serve and that's not the full potential of these new platforms, I think that is one case where you can obviously deliver better and richer experiences than you can with the current generation of technology.
brRPE5vJ5V PREMISE-Fact 2874 2901 Video is going really well.
C2HXu-YSIm PREMISE-Statistic 2902 3054 I shared a stat before in some of my comments that on Gear VR alone, we are now at more than 2 million hours of video have been watched on the platform,
bltdZFMwNq CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3055 3081 so that's really exciting.
VNsMAk6hTb NON-ARG 3082 3311 And that of course will be bolstered by the fact that these new 360 videos can not only be watched in VR, so in the headsets, but we're building tools so you can share them on News Feed and through our products elsewhere as well.
mCg5jabIum CLAIM-Reformulated 3312 3339 So I think that's exciting.
WNKKVEypMr NON-ARG 639 764 So on the acquisition philosophy, I've talked about how I think the social ecosystem will play out on a number of these calls
z_-Nt_MsZB PREMISE-Statistic 766 951 The basic theory that we have is that there are a small number of services that are going to be ubiquitous utilities that 1 billion or 2 billion or more people are going to want to use.
uhYZqwcP3j PREMISE-Fact 952 1103 So that's core basic messaging, the core functionality around having your real identity and connecting with all of your real friends and family online.
r90ztENOVn PREMISE-Other 1104 1172 Those are things that we just think are just going to be ubiquitous.
_7MrQWb4dt CLAIM-Other 1173 1199 So we want to build those.
jiZpton8fe NON-ARG 3340 3434 Over time there will be even more, but that I think should be enough to have some initial use.
AptpuxJSvY NON-ARG 3435 3523 But again, I do want to really emphasize, this is early and it's going take a long time.
hRrlULMPJd NON-ARG 3524 3645 And I know there's a lot of hype around this, and we're just focused on building this to be very good over the long term.
H0Z-AraqWb CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1200 1436 At the same time, we also think that there are going to be many, many good businesses and different other social use cases where there are people doing good work and building different companies that we feel no need to own those things.
pihj9vzyIL NON-ARG 1437 1534 So I think that people come up from time to time and suggest, should we buy this company or that.
y8HOu32uXD NON-ARG 1535 1691 And what we look at are what are the things that we think are going to be ubiquitous tools, and who are the most talented people in the world to build this.
syqT9UVX_Z NON-ARG 1692 1799 And so when you think about something like virtual and augmented reality, that's how we thought about that.
ok9BHL9CVl NON-ARG 1800 1852 Those are going to be important platforms over time.
ROM66Mbrej NON-ARG 1853 1879 It's very early obviously.
Y551ipMHPS NON-ARG 1880 1924 It's going to take a long time to get there.
wRJ16ibWUr NON-ARG 1925 2164 And a lot of what we felt like we were buying there was a critical mass of the best people and the best technology to go do all the things that we needed to go do over the next 10 years to drive that home and turn that into a big platform.
