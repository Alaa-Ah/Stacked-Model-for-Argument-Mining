JpxQJ_mjJo NON-ARG 1583 1655 Now, Mark, you were asking about video and its impact on pricing growth.
JbUA3yvtLi NON-ARG 1656 1733 I would probably step back and look at it from an overall system perspective.
wqLEKhsag0 NON-ARG 1734 1928 And so starting with the supply side, there's a variety of factors that will impact impression growth, and I mentioned slower ad growth and then increasing video watch time as being two of them.
8LTQ4Ogv7p NON-ARG 1929 2079 And given there's an auction that drives the pricing in how we run the business, there's always an interplay between supply growth and pricing growth.
le7FPijFBU CLAIM-Fact 2080 2158 And so what we're really focused on is driving better ROI for our advertisers.
dJECaBspbW PREMISE-Fact 2159 2454 And Sheryl alluded to it in her earlier commentary about if we get better at converting our impressions into things that are valuable for advertisers and we get more efficient in doing that, we'll be rewarded with better pricing and higher demand at better pricing as a result of that hard work.
ivwc1wJS8G NON-ARG 2455 2515 That doesn't necessarily specifically pertain just to video.
rSr0LsxRw0 NON-ARG 2516 2546 It really is across the board.
Y9uhw3Sa4E PREMISE-Fact 2547 2635 So if we're effective at continuing to do that, then that should benefit pricing growth.
EnFHZ7_JW9 PREMISE-Fact 2636 2741 And if we can grow demand faster than we grow supply, then we're going to see that play through in price.
ROORs2brp2 NON-ARG 2742 2881 And that's really the goal of a lot of the hard work that the ads team does to make our products better and more effective for advertisers.
4zlRzsnXjn CLAIM-Fact 754 859 On Ad Breaks, we're currently really just testing the ability to put a short Ad Break in uploaded videos.
Omygx18eLU NON-ARG 860 947 We do it if a video is longer than 90 seconds or live videos are longer than 4 minutes.
uFjbYcHNz9 NON-ARG 948 1059 We're just in the process right now of expanding to more publishers in the United States, so it's really early.
IlaOYbuTAD NON-ARG 1060 1125 In terms of the metrics we're looking for, it's a great question.
QzTJVCWXGV NON-ARG 1126 1339 And obviously, we care that people view the ads, but the most important thing is tying those ads impressions, even if they're short views, all the way through to that same purchase data that we keep talking about.
e4p8ZSSncU CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1340 1565 And so as we work on rolling out more Ad Breaks, and we are rolling out slowly, we're really focused on finding ways to help marketers measure the right things, and that's a very important focus for the company going forward.
