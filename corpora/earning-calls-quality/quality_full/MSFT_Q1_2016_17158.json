On the first one, on the mix between IaaS and PaaS and SaaS, the thing that we are seeing is, quite frankly, all of these are growing but the most interesting thing for me as a pattern is growth in IaaS leads to growth in other PaaS services or SaaS services. I mean to put it very concretely, take something like Azure Active Directory. That's probably the best manifestation of the virtuous cycle that we see in any of the cloud adoption that we have, right. It could be as someone coming from Office 365. It can be someone coming from Azure, Dynamics, EMS. All of those tenants get into Azure Active Directory which is our largest PaaS service because it's got even developer API, so that means more developers are using it. More IT professionals are using it as the control plane. So that's the network effect that we see when it comes to the PaaS services. And then in terms of infrastructure itself, as again I said, there's people who are tiering, even applications people who build hybrid applications where the storage could be even on premise in some cases, but the mid-tier and the web and the mobile back ends are in the cloud. We see a lot of growth there. We see a lot of growth in our data, both in terms of infrastructure but in the new services like our Data Lake services which are PaaS services. Hadoop is another good example. We see lots of Hadoop usage inside of IaaS but we also see HD inside growth. So I would say there is a real good mix of those two.

I think Amy talked about we have a $1 billion quarter with 29% growth and good share position growth in the United States. That's fantastic to see. But gaming is the other place where we talked about Xbox Live now that spans both console and PC. We see increased engagement because of that.
