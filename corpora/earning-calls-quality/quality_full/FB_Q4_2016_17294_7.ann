un3xqGKjEr NON-ARG 3264 3283 Heather, it's Dave.
ZaWqUIzNxr CLAIM-Fact 3284 3457 Just on Instagram versus Facebook and ad load, clearly the biggest driver of our business is core Facebook just in terms of sheer size and even sheer contribution to growth.
-flXATvIzI PREMISE-Fact 3458 3532 Instagram is growing quicker on a percentage basis, but it's much smaller.
C_R3bbWjSE CLAIM-Fact 3533 3582 The ad load opportunities are higher on Instagram
Vl9Aa2El2t PREMISE-Fact 3583 3637 because Instagram is at a lower ad load than Facebook,
xG1F3zKxda CLAIM-Fact 3638 3838 so there is an opportunity for us to continue to grow ad load on Instagram probably beyond â€“ in a longer timeframe than there is on Facebook because of that disparity in terms of where they are today.
4-De6q4SJs NON-ARG 3839 4145 But given the scale of Facebook and the importance of driving overall revenue, that's why I continue to express what our expectations are for advertising growth in 2017 and the reduction in the growth rate that we expect, given the potential to grow ad load on Facebook that we expect to come down in 2017.
kRp1kWKqjw NON-ARG 707 765 I'll take Messenger and WhatsApp and you can take ad load.
ZSEkX_d3O5 CLAIM-Fact 766 867 So yes is the basic answer that Messenger and WhatsApp serve somewhat different utilities for people.
zX0Nttx4Gz PREMISE-Fact 868 949 WhatsApp really takes the place of SMS in a lot of the markets where it operates.
vkeH0BKsBH PREMISE-Fact 950 986 The graph is based on phone numbers.
JpaouUlan3 PREMISE-Fact 987 1136 You're as likely to text your barber or someone that you're going to transact with, who you would have a phone number with, as you would be a friend.
DHVF4N6xAS PREMISE-Fact 1137 1362 Whereas on Facebook Messenger, the graph is your friends, and you're more likely to, say, wish an acquaintance happy birthday on Facebook Messenger than on WhatsApp or you might not have their phone number in the first place.
34iDJrsjuY PREMISE-Fact 1363 1479 So you can think about some overlap in the core use case, you might message your close friends and family on either.
N4DyJU4Gwg PREMISE-Fact 1480 1792 But what we found in general is that if you look at some of the markets that are strongest for both of them, they can each grow in those markets, and as messaging has become more affordable and more reliable for people, the volumes of messaging have just gone through the roof in terms of what people want to do.
1-1qi8bzcD PREMISE-Statistic 1793 1982 My understanding from looking at a bunch of analytics is that the peak of global SMS reached somewhere in the low 20 billion messages per day, and we already have many times more than that.
0YFu5LWrM5 PREMISE-Fact 1983 2049 Three times or more, more than that across WhatsApp and Messenger.
HRYSes3xku PREMISE-Statistic 2050 2136 And, of course, there are other messaging products in the world besides these as well.
0nOuBmeLfk CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2137 2201 So we're pretty confident that this is going to keep on growing.
gXJiCbxwu9 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2202 2340 I do think to your point that the monetization paths are going to be somewhat different, reflecting the differences in product philosophy.
5UUYT6JOAm PREMISE-Fact 2341 2463 So Messenger is much more focused on being an expressive and rich environment that has lots of different types of content.
MSW4RdpNa6 PREMISE-Fact 2464 2710 Kind of more like Facebook to the Instagram example that we used before, whereas WhatsApp I think is a much more utilitarian experience with a much more stark UI where there's just not as much emphasis on having a lot of different ways to engage.
m2Hf1kPbCI NON-ARG 2711 3013 So we did the experiment that you asked about before around ads and Messenger and different ways that businesses can interact and there's a lot of flexibility around how we can explore there, which is why I think you'll see more of that on the Messenger side than on the WhatsApp side in the near term.
W3dX5djjhK NON-ARG 3014 3246 But giving businesses the opportunity to connect in WhatsApp and reach the people that they want and eventually have increasingly, hopefully, transactional interactions I think will be a really useful thing on that platform as well.
