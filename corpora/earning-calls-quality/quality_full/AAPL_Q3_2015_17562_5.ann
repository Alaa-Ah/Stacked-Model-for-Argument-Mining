cWhLNksbRS NON-ARG 750 792 Okay Gene, let me start with gross margin.
BCbqgOrFir NON-ARG 793 855 As Tim said before, obviously we guide to the current quarter.
7U7-VvnPQc PREMISE-RealExample 1047 1123 So for example, currency markets can be very different one year to the next.
ctpcRC9eIt PREMISE-RealExample 1231 1298 Commodity markets may be very different from one year to the other.
qJHLMoYn1y PREMISE-RealExample 1124 1230 We know that the next year is going to represent an additional challenge given where the dollar has moved.
Qru6zdv68e CLAIM-Fact 1299 1373 There are things that remain relatively similar as we launch new products.
dFwumL45Hp PREMISE-RealExample 1374 1412 For example, we innovate the products.
Vf_3GvRMwb PREMISE-RealExample 1413 1611 We want to make them better all the time, and that typically requires additional cost and so the cost structures of our products, new products, tend to be higher than the products that they replace.
znlPKcun8n CLAIM-Reformulated 980 1046 There are also things that are not necessarily within our control.
XdcO9degKL CLAIM-Reformulated 1793 1933 Of course maybe the one thing that I want to point out again as we get into the following year, is that of course currency will be an issue.
l0wJqbQ-B0 NON-ARG 1748 1792 I think this should give you a bit of color.
mbHxy2sEvZ NON-ARG 1612 1747 Having said that, as you know we've got a very, very good track record to reduce those cost factors over the lifecycle of the products.
mRNfCMSWMQ NON-ARG 1987 2010 Yeah Gene, this is Tim.
YFJXYpsorp NON-ARG 2011 2044 Let me talk about the Watch some.
HzGoxLXgYg NON-ARG 2045 2320 As you know, we made a decision back in September, quite several months ago not to disclose the shipments on the Watch and that was not a matter of not being transparent, it was a matter of not giving our competition insight that's a product that we've worked really hard on.
zjKJCntEvI NON-ARG 2321 2405 However, let me give you some color so to avoid reaching sort of a wrong conclusion.
eXJy_ZTxIp CLAIM-Other 2406 2636 If you look at the other products category and look at the revenue in this category, it would not be an accurate thing to just look at the sequential change or the year over year change and assume that were the total Watch revenue
G-q-IigFOp PREMISE-Fact 2637 2736 because the aggregate balance of that category, both sequentially and year over year, is shrinking.
asqBQ1GMkc PREMISE-Fact 2737 2853 Obviously iPod is a part of that, but there are other things in there, accessories and so forth, that are shrinking.
_LrbFKAGRy CLAIM-Fact 2854 3018 Secondly to provide a bit more color, sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations and they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter.
L8lxjhR6r1 PREMISE-Fact 3019 3223 And to give you a little additional insight, through the end of the quarter, in fact the Apple Watch sell-through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the original iPad.
nOBOxChJqc PREMISE-Fact 3224 3288 And we were able to do that with having only 680 points of sale.
5GYQ_-yFf0 PREMISE-Fact 3289 3455 And as you probably know, as I had reviewed earlier, the online sales were so great at the beginning, we were not able to feed inventory to our stores until mid-June.
HGr0Tl8X0Z CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3607 3686 And so as I look at all of these things, we feel really great about how we did.
I0eGYhrf13 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4625 4730 And so I sort of back up and look at this and I feel fantastic about what the team has done and delivered
L4rSVCJyWI PREMISE-RealExample 4731 4822 and I know I never go anywhere without the Watch and it's not because I'm the CEO of Apple.
eboUqU4Oe_ PREMISE-RealExample 4823 4915 I'm that attached to it and I get lots of notes from a lot of people that feel the same way.
Ez9IvKSkaP NON-ARG 4916 4954 And so that's how I look at the Watch.
HMePAX97uZ CLAIM-Fact 3687 3743 Now our objective for the quarter wasn't primarily sales
Hws4jIkVpS PREMISE-Fact 4079 4169 Even though the store layout was delayed, we've learned a lot about the buying experience.
FJLlINsjvc CLAIM-Policy 4170 4255 Based on that experience, we're now planning to expand our channel before the holiday
gHkFBMdBo9 PREMISE-Other 4256 4353 because we're convinced that the Watch is going to be one of the top gifts of the holiday season.
Ke4NN6wU0F CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4354 4428 Now most importantly of all of this is that customer sat is off the charts
DcmeB4iHyQ PREMISE-Other 4429 4550 because we've constantly seen if you can get the customer sat off the charts you can wind up doing fairly well over time.
VDdhw6PH6K PREMISE-Other 3745 3892 Beyond the very good news on sales, we're more excited about how the product is positioned for the long term because we're starting a new category.
WaHaJ_yZoc PREMISE-Fact 3893 3947 And as I back up and look at this, we have 8,500 apps.
kGV-RcbBvn NON-ARG 4551 4624 We've also learned a lot about managing quite an assortment and so forth.
nN6XOFSKpM PREMISE-RealExample 3948 4009 We've already announced the next operating system, watchOS 2.
vUbbs4jX2v PREMISE-RealExample 4010 4078 It will bring native apps which are going to be killer to the Watch.
HbGDkdKwoR CLAIM-Opinion(view) 901 979 I think there are, you know every cycle is different for a variety of reasons.
CFsXvNZZbb NON-ARG 855 901  You know, as we look at it at a macro level. 
aQivmkgnDw NON-ARG 3455 3607  And so those points of sale pretty much, the overwhelming majority of the low numbers of sales were not there until the last two weeks of the quarter.
