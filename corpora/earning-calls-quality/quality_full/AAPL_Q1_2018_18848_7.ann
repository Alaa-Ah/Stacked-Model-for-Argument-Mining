me_nLwebit NON-ARG 653 705 Mike, you did a good job of answering your question.
h3KeCDUfDl PREMISE-Other 1529 1556 I see AR as being profound.
-R4uBmsWXS PREMISE-Hypothesis 1557 1642 I think, AR has the ability to amplify human performance instead of isolating humans.
R8jaDsSrYq CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1643 1683 And so I am a huge, huge believer in AR.
nnekDfU6Zx CLAIM-Fact 1684 1732 We put a lot of energy on AR removing very fast.
nciafczHCS PREMISE-RealExample 1733 1793 We've gone from ARkit 1.0 to 1.5 in just a matter of months.

jYZKSc4-Tb PREMISE-Fact 849 920 And as we said when we launched it, we were setting up the next decade.
lIJbpxoiUf NON-ARG 921 951 And that is how we look at it.
Ppa1uRHiwC CLAIM-Fact 952 1017 And so that's the reason it's chockfull of incredible innovation.
