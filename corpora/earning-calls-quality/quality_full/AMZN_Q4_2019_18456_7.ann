4nBWLkPSFV NON-ARG 827 832 Sure.
8mS3B-bunY NON-ARG 833 877 Let me make sure the numbers are understood.
ad20veIuVH PREMISE-Statistic 878 988 We had talked about last year about an initial step up in cost of close to $800 million in the second quarter.
IPdtsXfC0c PREMISE-Fact 989 1044 We -- that carried into Q3-- was slightly higher in Q3.
E0hYq73WKh PREMISE-Statistic 1045 1147 And then in Q4, last time on this call I mentioned that we estimated Q4 would be $1.5 billion penalty.
qyUvia4_mQ PREMISE-Fact 1148 1246 It was slightly under that despite the higher volumes and revenue growth than was in our guidance.
VLmYKt1BCW PREMISE-Statistic 1247 1344 And looking ahead to Q1, we estimate approximately $1 billion of additional costs year-over-year.
BNA36USnyr CLAIM-Fact 1345 1387 And again, in Q2, we'll start to lap this.
4XXMmcuKPn NON-ARG 1596 1699 So, I will keep you posted on our results and guide in the future as to where we see those costs going.
fAyMbpAnuq CLAIM-Fact 1700 1795 If you look at the efficiency or the -- first the cost, they generally fall into a few buckets.
mApRV7jdmB PREMISE-Fact 1796 1907 It's obviously transportation where you're building out new transportation modes, you're adding new deliveries.
RwEGEy6AEs PREMISE-Fact 1908 1939 Partners are adding new routes.
Nwu9sGGmja PREMISE-Fact 1940 2102 Many times they start with subscale volumes and you build them out, you get more efficient, you get more volume, more package density and that creates efficiency.
MVArrN51Q0 NON-ARG 1388 1433 And that doesn't mean the delta goes to zero.
mMFlgQ96PX NON-ARG 1434 1595 It means that there'll be a step up as we grow and expand on a volume basis and then we'll see where our rates are on actually delivering and fulfilling one day.
