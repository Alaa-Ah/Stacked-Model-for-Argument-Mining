Let me start with the Office Consumer question. We haven't had a chance to touch on that. And then we'll talk about Commercial seat growth.

The growth in quarter versus our expectations was really two things that are transactionally focused. One, the PC market was a little bit better than we thought. And particularly in developed markets, the PC growth was better than we thought. And developed markets are where we see the most transactional business with Consumer Office that impacts in quarter. So the strength from that outperformance or better market in consumer PCs in developed markets is a direct correlation to our performance in Office Consumer.

We have a lot of yen exposure in that segment, so the Japan performance being better also helped. And that is a purely \u2013 it's more transactional than even our rest-of-world business.
