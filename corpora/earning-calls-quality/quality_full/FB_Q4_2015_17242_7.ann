JErk9alH_P NON-ARG 703 728 So, on the apps question,
kSjL6W2X6G CLAIM-Fact 729 849 the ones that have done the best are things that augment core Facebook functionality for large subsets of the community.
yImmCcYxi3 PREMISE-Fact 850 898 So, for example, we have this Pages Manager App.
v99iTxRhAu PREMISE-Statistic 899 959 There are 50 million businesses that have pages on Facebook.
NySBnbZpMx NON-ARG 960 1103 And while that is not a huge number compared to the size of the overall community of people, it’s a very large number of people and businesses.
3j_KMd2pX1 PREMISE-Statistic 1372 1609 We have introduced a number of things like that for public figures, for groups, messengers, probably been the most successful; it’s something that’s connected to the Facebook experience that now has more than 800 million people using it.
Do2pXwxaLY CLAIM-Fact 1610 1708 So, I do think that there’re additional opportunities for this and we’ll continue looking at them.
yo3NPPgToS NON-ARG 1722 1773 Ben just following up on VR and supply constraints,
LCrGN1jj8O CLAIM-Fact 1774 1798 so we have two products.
MeqCH4ox94 PREMISE-RealExample 1799 1940 You’ve got Gear VR and Samsung is really handling all of that from a hardware perspective, and obviously they’re well prepared on that front.
TWXyOBhjmo PREMISE-Fact 1941 2047 With Rift, it’s really -- it’s early in the evolution of VR; it’s early to be talking about large volumes.
V6YbACf8FL CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2048 2151 So, at this point I don’t think we’re giving a lot of color around supply chain and that sort of thing.
RH9rSbX8aT PREMISE-Fact 2152 2210 It’s not going to be material to our financials this year.
Mby4gjUWCl PREMISE-Fact 1104 1371 And giving a focused experience for the person who wants to run their business through Facebook and be communicating with their customers all day long, that’s just proven to be an incredibly engaging experience that drives content into the system and is good overall.
