xcHjAcz1L8 NON-ARG 922 927 Sure.
IUjjoTpAAx CLAIM-Fact 928 1087 So the fulfillment network as we built it, yes, they'll be more productive next year than they are this holiday peak and probably even more productive in 2018.
VE5V48g9z3 PREMISE-Fact 1088 1271 So I can't forecast it for you into next year quite yet, but we certainly had productivity add additional cost to Q3 and even into Q4 of this year as we build the additional capacity.
S6jfVkNDvj PREMISE-Fact 1272 1433 Again, the underlying reason for that capacity build is the strength in paid units and even more so in the units that we're fulfilling driven by our FBA program.
rhzgF1aLc7 CLAIM-Fact 1434 1488 The FBA program is a key pillar of our Prime offering.
a7HkVF3BFb CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1627 1662 So we're glad to have that problem.
QU-XjPZ2zA PREMISE-Fact 1663 1758 We are just working very hard to get capacity in place and in productive use for Q4 and beyond.
KaxMN2ytto PREMISE-Fact 1489 1507 It adds selection.
gor2YZCP69 PREMISE-Fact 1508 1626 It makes Prime stronger and then that's a self-reinforcing where Prime then â€“ the Prime success attract mores sellers.

qaGYoLxyYU NON-ARG 1798 2021 On the AWS question, yeah, we continue to invest in AWS on behalf of our customers in addition to the technologies that make integrations easier that helps companies move from an on-prem or a hybrid IT environment into AWS.
sCdgGbwgOa NON-ARG 2022 2238 So we're going to continue to do that, specifically things like the database migration tool that are helpful for customers when they move production databases from on premises to the cloud with virtually no downtime.
fgFHsVmRVT NON-ARG 2239 2450 And also many of our AWS customers are beginning to choose and continue to choose the AWS Schema Conversion Tool which really switches database engines to get out of old guard proprietary databases and onto AWS.
bHRUVUCuvz NON-ARG 2451 2545 And so we'll continue to react to customer needs and that will include opening up new regions.
ErjTgXvsoV NON-ARG 2546 2679 We've opened up Ohio this past quarter and we've highlighted that we'll have another number of regions coming online in a few months.
