One of the things that had been interesting, while we were watching these different services grow, was just how quickly multiple different messaging and communication services were growing at the same time, and it seemed a little bit counter-intuitive at first because it seemed like there should have been more overlap than it actually, now in retrospect looking back, seems like there is. So you can look at countries where both services, WhatsApp and Messenger, are growing very quickly like Brazil, for example.

Facebook Messenger people use to connect with people that they know on Facebook primarily.
