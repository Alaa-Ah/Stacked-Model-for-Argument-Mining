eQtuHcn23W CLAIM-Opinion(view) 910 1055 On the OEM side, the way to think about those comments is we do expect inventory levels to likely remain low as we exit the next quarter as well.
_UM7FtetqH CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1056 1150 So think about there having -- because your -- we do expect chip supply to remain constrained.
TrwPYEIHrh CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1151 1240 I don't expect to see any impact from changing inventory levels through the next quarter.
0y_-eZF3tz CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1342 1527 I do think what we will see in Q3 is we're expecting a little better performance in the Pro side of the market in terms of seeing growth there, and that's probably helping a little bit.
eCylfBS6dh CLAIM-Fact 1528 1698 To your second question on Office -- I'm sorry, on Windows Commercial overall, our real investment -- and you're right, we are starting to reach some tougher comparables.
jMwRVgQeKP CLAIM-Fact 1241 1341 So I would sort of remove that as one of the mechanisms you're thinking about on overall OEM demand.

XASBqmDF7e PREMISE-Fact 2213 2242 It's sold with Microsoft 365.
DmKEyQeiWg PREMISE-Fact 2243 2305 It's about the selling motion of E3 and E5 that we talk about.
eIAMRftTwv PREMISE-Fact 2306 2420 If you could almost take out that 606 impact in the billings team to almost mirror the Microsoft 365 SKUs we sell.
