flrJjiuCwt CLAIM-Fact 1470 1750 So, the way we need to drive sales around the world is by understanding markets, launching things like click to missed call ads in India and making sure our products work for market but also being able to connect to those advertising metrics and business metrics around the world.

nsPUgO4S9v PREMISE-Statistic 1892 1940 We have 500 million people watching video a day.
