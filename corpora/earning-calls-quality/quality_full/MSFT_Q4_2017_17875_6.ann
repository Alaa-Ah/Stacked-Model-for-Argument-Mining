0EkQXoRDyY NON-ARG 471 476 Sure.
QmnRSAUL5v PREMISE-Fact 477 645 When you think about, you are right, it is a big number, and I feel very good about it, and for the year on a pure basis it was $15 billion of commercial cloud revenue.
epOFHq3Ad5 CLAIM-Fact 646 938 So we are starting to get to that point Mark where you have a big base, which is still growing at a fast rate, and so especially ARR numbers can see big jumps in the one that you saw this quarter, and your right, Q4 is also historically quite a big quarter and this one certainly was as well.
fG_cu4XyAD CLAIM-Reformulated 939 1316 But you also saw - and what really does matter, especially in Azure is usage of growth, really consumption growth having customers use deploy, be successful, and really continue to get you think sort of meters up and running and that continues to build on itself, and so when you start to see that you can, and I do think and we will continue to see good growth in this number.
fepO_9VgUK CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1542 1658 Let me start by saying, first I feel very good about meeting our stated goal of $20 billion in commercial cloud ARR.
--B2E2hitt CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1659 1935 Next, I think across every service the momentum we’ve seen in Q4 and in particular, I would say, I think not many people focus on it, but even things like Windows E5, advanced threat protection services, those types of deployments really will add to momentum in our offerings.
j0xH7maY5Q CLAIM-Fact 1936 2000 One of the things we often talk about is, we sell Microsoft 365.
ArQy4kPBmq PREMISE-Fact 2001 2048 That’s Windows 10 with securities and services.
kii2MGCsEu PREMISE-Fact 2049 2130 It is a modern workplace that includes up-to-date Office 365 and it includes EMS.
YgoPf9OzVQ PREMISE-Fact 2131 2177 We really did see strength across all of them.
TWol-0sp_s CLAIM-Reformulated 2178 2283 So I don't really think it’s about a percentage, but it’s about each of them continuing to make progress.
