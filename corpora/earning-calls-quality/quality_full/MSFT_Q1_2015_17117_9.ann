XaFXY35Bz3 NON-ARG 853 942 We talked pretty extensively about the customer case studies at our cloud event last week
SeHxqNAYEa CLAIM-Fact 779 852 And as far as the used cases, right now it’s actually pretty diversified.
3-KjRQ3c0V PREMISE-Fact 944 1034 And it turns out that we have ISVs in many cases driving new applications on top of Azure.
tZ6bQs5Q-z PREMISE-Fact 1035 1136 There are businesses like for example NVC that are reinventing their business models on top of Azure.
T1ZDa94Zne PREMISE-Fact 1137 1414 We have customers using us for true hybrid, if you were deploying for example a SQL server, you can have high availability using Azure that’s a pretty common deployment now using Azure as the backplane for disaster recovery and high availability, that’s for sure is a workload.
SkfxBgSk2W PREMISE-Fact 1415 1686 But at this point I would say, we have emerging ISVs, some of the global ISVs building SaaS applications on top of Azure driving a significant amount of growth of new businesses, the new business models emerging on Azure, as well as hybrid, which I would say are driving.
D7aEW1gPI- PREMISE-Fact 1687 1747 One of the other categories that I see lot of lately is IOT.
mlxtanAfkW PREMISE-Fact 1748 2065 And the way we participate just on the Azure side, we obviously participate even with our Windows Embedded, but on the cloud side, we are seeing the attach to our emerging machine learning services as well as advanced analytics that’s been one of the place where we are well suited for some of the emerging use cases.
