fw_6Nf079W NON-ARG 497 513 I can take that.
x7JPOZKj-D NON-ARG 514 574 When you think about feed, what people are doing is sharing.
doIx8d-IwV NON-ARG 575 617 They're sharing in Instagram and Facebook.
9pMLUyzdzS CLAIM-Fact 618 710 And that means there's, in many ways, almost limitless opportunity for consumers to do more.
0JW6yiVBZ- CLAIM-Opinion(view) 711 1051 I think we've made some strong changes on Facebook in terms of meaningful social interactions, and I think the history of our ability to develop and iterate on consumer products shows that we can help people as they evolve, share the things they want to share, and have a very meaningful and important experience in feed as they're sharing.
xDBBSNzpXJ PREMISE-Fact 1052 1235 Feed is fundamentally about information being pushed to a consumer and us helping figure out what is most interesting and most engaging and I think, in many ways, positive for people.
RvvfmlMU5O CLAIM-Fact 1370 1422 Along with that, goes the advertising opportunities.
9FY94q5-Tm CLAIM-Reformulated 1423 1593 As there are more Stories and feed, as more people are engaged in Facebook and increasingly in Instagram, that gives us more opportunities just on the supply side of ads.
r-5Oltoato PREMISE-Fact 1594 1860 On the demand side, all of the things we do to get more advertisers active in our system, means we'll have more ads to choose from, to make those ads more relevant, to measure the ROI of those ads so that people can then iterate and, again, make those more relevant.
p_ZevbhIvr CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1236 1369 And I think the product teams, led by Mark, have done a great job of that over time and you're seeing the continued investment there.
eSPj-da4J4 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1861 1946 I think we've made real improvements there, but I think there's a lot more we can do.
Ps0gos-KOT PREMISE-Fact 1947 2112 And one of the ways I talk to people about it is just ask what percentage of the ads do you see in your feed are as good as the very best posts you see from friends.
CjrnBHS26o NON-ARG 2113 2261 And I think most people will honestly say that certainly compared to a few years ago, those ads are much more relevant to them, but not all of them.
xrOqawVdYe CLAIM-Reformulated 2262 2507 And you can see in that example, even in your own feed, the opportunities we have to improve, finding the right ad and giving it to the right person at the right time, which drives businesses all around the world and drives our business as well.
