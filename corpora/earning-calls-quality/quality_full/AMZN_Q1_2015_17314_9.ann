cxD1lIxMcl CLAIM-Fact 541 716 So Mark, I can't comment on the derive number, but I can say that FBA continues to grow really well, it’s become a bigger and bigger part of our third party mix over the years
2BgEinjSJz PREMISE-Statistic 718 805 I think we gave you an update in Q4 that it was more than 40% of our third party units.
FhSS_7EoW8 NON-ARG 985 1045 So I don’t know if there is much more we can say about that.
OoYePl5AgR NON-ARG 806 984 Obviously in the fulfillment line there is cost associated with that as well, as our other third party units as well I think like payment processing and other cost that we incur.
qTFCwFFP_f PREMISE-Statistic 1336 1630 Let's take a look at the guidance that we gave, again, we gave as we have in previous quarters, we gave the wide range and from a consolidate segment operating standpoint we gave a 100 to 650, the implied margin at the lower end, the higher end is approximately 50 basis points upwards to 2.9%.
DAx9WssOkG PREMISE-Statistic 1631 1841 This quarter in Q1 we were up 60 basis points year-over-year in total at the upper end of that forecast implied would be up 80 basis points, so again, that’s the range and we think its appropriate range for Q2.
