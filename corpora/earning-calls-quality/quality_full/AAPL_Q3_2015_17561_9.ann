_eAAGwRoSC NON-ARG 369 382 This is Luca.
A3u-u3yogc PREMISE-Statistic 1839 2120 Yeah, so as we mentioned, the ASP for iPhone was up $99, 18% increase year-over-year and this is really driven by the mix, by the fact that we've added iPhone 6 Plus to a new price point and in general, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are doing extremely well as a percentage of the portfolio.
nxo8gfWERi PREMISE-Statistic 2121 2212 And keep in mind that this $99 was partially offset by $24 of unfavorable foreign exchange.
liKx6fle53 PREMISE-Fact 2213 2255 So the number would have been even better.
XvvqKHTcLn CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2286 2444 And I think we talked about it in prior calls, the 6 Plus is doing particularly well in the markets that you would expect, Greater China, other Asian markets.
FfzdBxDBOW CLAIM-Reformulated 2445 2578 Those are markets where our growth rates are particularly strong and the 6 Plus, because of the screen size, is doing extremely well.
rrG6aageJ2 NON-ARG 2256 2284 So yes, clearly 6 and 6 Plus
glOL23fikH NON-ARG 383 515 So we got into 38.5% to 39.5%, and so just keep in mind last year in Q4, our gross margin declined by 140 basis points sequentially.
XGbZUkUjpD CLAIM-Opinion(view) 516 586 So this year we're expecting a sequential decline of 220 basis points.
LcOeDz9mq7 NON-ARG 587 639 I would point to three main factors for the decline.
BbcGnQABIM PREMISE-Fact 640 779 First of all, to your point around foreign exchange, it continues to be a challenging environment given the strengthening of the US dollar.
cuwgVzWPYj PREMISE-Statistic 780 875 In our case, the impact on margin after the hedges is going to be about 30 basis points for Q4.
Uk-dJDAh0U PREMISE-Fact 876 1002 Also, I want to point to a different mix, which is typical of our seasonality as we enter the back-to-school season during Q4.
s1XgB2-4QK PREMISE-Fact 1003 1088 And thirdly, the transition cost that you've mentioned as we prepare for a busy fall.
xm72KEo5Ov NON-ARG 1179 1356 I would point that in general costs continue to be, particularly commodity costs continue to be favorable and so there would be a partial offset to the factors that I mentioned.
YFGBwaMr0d NON-ARG 1089 1178 And so those are the three factors that will have an impact on gross margin sequentially.
be4DhXJbIg NON-ARG 357 368 Definitely.
