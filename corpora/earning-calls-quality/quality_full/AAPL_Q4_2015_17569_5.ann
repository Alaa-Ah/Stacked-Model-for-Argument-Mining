mMZ4X06ZJ4 NON-ARG 1609 1915 So that's how I look at that. In terms of your first comment, you didn't asked me to comment on that, but just to be clear, our forecasting doesn't work like you articulated it. I recognize that people can have their own models and so forth, but just to make it clear that I'm not agreeing with your point.
ORZKwdqdOf NON-ARG 910 959 We don't guide beyond December, as you know Toni.
5Cw4v9i4TD CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1238 1319 The same – my same response applies and I think we'll do quite good in iPhone. I 
rTiqyMIm1A PREMISE-Other 1319 1608 do believe we'll grow this quarter as we put in our guidance that when you start with a number in the low 30s in terms of the percentage of the installed base that’s upgraded that had a phone pre the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, that number still likely to leave a lot of headroom beyond December.
Or6bAZHpWG PREMISE-Fact 960 1207 I do think that the sort of the macro things that I spoke about earlier, the upgrade programs, the Android Switcher rate, the iPhone momentum in the emerging markets and the LTE penetration in these markets these trends are not one quarter things.
ZH-H0yjSqg PREMISE-Fact 1208 1237 These are longer term things.
p0LMB-2-Lv NON-ARG 4076 4180 And beyond the first quarter as you know we're not guiding and so we'll see over the course of the year.
7oMzBUgfqn CLAIM-Reformulated 4012 4075 So, overall we feel very strong guidance for the first quarter.
Yecm1kCkrJ CLAIM-Value 3242 3449 I think my conclusion is that the guidance that we're providing for the first quarter that 39% to 40% it actually an incredible level of guidance given the foreign exchange headwinds that we're dealing with.
5vZaVHFpgI NON-ARG 2645 3062 Yes. I think, Toni, it’s a very good point, I mean, what's going to happen in practice is that we got this portfolio of hedge comp such that over time provides protection to our margins and to our results, but that protection diminishes as we go through the year and so we should expect that in over time during the course of fiscal 2016 that protection will come off assuming that the dollar stays at current levels.
1mHyTgwYVa PREMISE-Fact 3063 3241 Keep in mind, there are some currencies around the world that where we cannot economically hedge and so those currencies are bit excluded from what we're talking about right now.
aV5BlJGnCp NON-ARG 3450 4011 How do we deal with that? We continue to hedge, so our program continues on an ongoing basis and we will continue to provide some level of protection to foreign exchange movement. In some cases we have realign prices particularly when we launch new products. We tend to do that in a number of countries where the foreign exchange moves have been particularly extreme, and so we tend to recover that through pricing. And then finally, of course we are putting in place a number of cost initiatives that would allow us to deal with the foreign exchange situation.
