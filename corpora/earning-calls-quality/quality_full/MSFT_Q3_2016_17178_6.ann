wq2w71dAd4 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1274 1350 So we think about this part more holistically, and same thing with Dynamics.
83xc_YD2fe PREMISE-Fact 768 971 First of all, when Amy and I think about both our CapEx as well as our OpEx, both at the engineering side as well as on our sales and marketing side, we think about this still at a Microsoft cloud level.
ARGDZ358Cz PREMISE-Hypothesis 972 1273 Just because if you take something like Enterprise Mobility Suite, that gives you an indication of how, for example, we attach to Office 365 essentially an infrastructure service that has SaaS-like margins, or even some of our application services in Azure that attach to Office developer experiences.
3koZneTtJI CLAIM-Fact 1351 1461 But having said that, if to your specific question of where our differentiation lies, the first one is hybrid.
-__7Cfq3eY CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2568 2703 So I think the mix of our gross, or rather that mix will define our long-term gross margin and operating margin for our cloud services.
zwLHVI348n NON-ARG 728 742 Sure, Heather.
-rbVVngciR NON-ARG 743 767 Thanks for the question.
Fa09kLdCPE PREMISE-Other 1462 1554 Most people think about hybrid where they think about the cloud as the edge of their server.
YuFC2IFFiV PREMISE-Fact 1555 1605 We obviously support that with all of our servers.
ILFeDIFBP1 PREMISE-Fact 1606 1780 Every server product of ours has cloud enrollment right, whether it be SQL, whether it be Windows Server, and you'll see that increasingly, even in this next wave of servers.
430JKvXTzH CLAIM-Fact 1781 1847 But we also think of in fact our servers as the edge of our cloud.
ZS0mBMupBW PREMISE-Other 1848 1952 That I think is where the world is going to go to, where distributed computing will remain distributers.
xvPiEfOd_i PREMISE-Fact 1953 2004 So Azure's stack is completely unique to Microsoft.
BLyKgKmr9b PREMISE-Fact 2005 2094 No one else who is in the public cloud business at any scale has that kind of capability.
JBX90W2Qsc CLAIM-Reformulated 2095 2150 So I would say that's another point of differentiation.
Lwxm4kVt8w CLAIM-Fact 2151 2254 So to your point about margins, I feel that we actually will have software licenses with hybrid rights.
5SLW-7Vnxd PREMISE-Fact 2255 2291 That's a different margin structure.
fB94MeuM9K PREMISE-Fact 2292 2433 We will have IaaS services, and you talked about the existence, proof at least from Amazon about what margins at scale can be achieved there.
Ym3FUY1CQe PREMISE-Fact 2434 2567 We have PaaS services in infrastructure like EMS that have SaaS-like margins, and then of course we have SaaS services in Office 365.
xA1Ivwtm7I PREMISE-Hypothesis 2704 2787 But the mix will also shift each quarter, just because the mix is not a stable mix.
GUuZpSdABo CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2788 2843 We'll see growth in different parts at different times.
PbMeeaNcUZ NON-ARG 2889 2909  Thank you, Heather.
BkvlozRnjX NON-ARG 2910 2943 We'll go to the next one, please.
