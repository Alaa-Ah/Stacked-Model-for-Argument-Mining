We do look at engagement and we like the engagement of customers who have Echoes. But let me step back a minute and give some highlights on that, Alexa and Echo together. As we mentioned in our press release, the unit sales of Echoes grew nine times, 9x, year-over-year during the holiday period. So, great customer adoption. We're really glad to see that and that creates a great base of Echo and Alexa fans out there.

And just as importantly, tens of thousands of developers are also using the Alexa Voice Service to help integrate Alexa into their products, which then creates a great network effect.
