Mark, on the subject of media content on Facebook, it seems like the big opportunity is for Facebook to be the portal with which to access the short form video content that you mentioned earlier, and maybe the idea is to keep the consumption of that content in line or inside the Facebook wall, the garden. So the follow-up question that I would have is how do you think you could best partner with the media providers and convince them the merits of bringing their valuable, in some cases expensive, content into the Facebook world, particularly at a time in media when they're really trying hard to guard their own existing ecosystems? And then a question for Sheryl. I wonder if you could just touch on the relative growth of branded advertising versus direct response ads. You mentioned total ratings point buying.

And we've got good feedback so far on that. We're working with a small set of partners to start, and we'll roll it out beyond that as that keeps on going.

There are a lot of people who are just sharing content socially, right, because they want to get a message out. That may not be business motivated. There are a lot of folks who are business motivated but who primarily post content in order to promote something or gain distribution for something. And that you can gain value without some kind of rev share, and that's why the video ecosystem has grown so quickly even before we rolled out a revenue share.
