lKEZJq74OB NON-ARG 788 799 Sure, Mark.
WNFhyvjW4U NON-ARG 800 817 Let me take that.
IfYCfl5xeP CLAIM-Fact 818 911 So GDPR didn't have a significant impact in Q2, partially because of its implementation date.
TMwWdZyMz- PREMISE-Fact 912 982 So you're just seeing effectively one month of it in terms of revenue.
5PzYDk1m6Y CLAIM-Opinion(view) 983 1121 We do think that there will be some modest impact, and I don't want to overplay these factors, but you've got a couple of things going on.
1KdmOQ3EQw PREMISE-Fact 1122 1159 You've got the impact of the opt-outs
BUe6z0dekB CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1161 1274 And while we're very pleased with the vast majority of people opting into the third-party data use, some did not.
TX_SDkOJdI CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1275 1326 So that will have a small impact on revenue growth.
J1YnLvAvuI PREMISE-Fact 1327 1421 And then we're seeing some impact from how advertisers are using their own data for targeting.
OcBQ0h6iEq CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1422 1474 So, again, that will have a modest impact on growth.
A1USfYACTa CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1475 1644 And then in addition, we're continuing to focus our product development around putting privacy first and that's going to, we believe, have some impact on revenue growth.
gPuFifAAeb NON-ARG 1645 1744 So it's really a combination of kind of how we're approaching privacy as well as GDPR and the like.
S-oSEDW3VU NON-ARG 1745 1881 So I think all of those factors together are one of the factors that we're talking about; the other being, obviously, the currency flip.
