So overall sharing is up across Facebook, and people are spending more time on Facebook and the whole family of apps. And that is not just the case for the aggregate of the growing community, but it's actually also the case on a per-person basis as well in terms of people sharing more and spending more time individually. Now one of the things that we see is that the way that we are sharing is always changing, and some of this is because of underlying technical transition. So on desktop, for example, it's easier to type, so we saw more text posts. On mobile, it's easier to take videos, so we see more videos. On desktop, people would have more commonly uploaded an album of photos that they took from their digital camera and downloaded onto their computer; whereas on mobile, the more common behavior is to take a single photo or a couple and just post those. So there are all these transitions. And that's our job, is to make it so that we build great tools that people \u2013 everyone around the world can share anything that they want with everyone. Now the other thing that's also true is that people want to share with lots of different kinds of audiences. So Facebook gives you the ability to share with all of your friends and publicly if you want and with groups. But we're also investing in things like Messenger and WhatsApp because a lot of people want to share increasingly messages privately one on one or with very small groups. So in addition to Messenger, which is at 900 million people a month, and WhatsApp, which is at more than 1 billion people a month, Facebook Groups is also at more than 1 billion people a month, which I think represents the increasing diversity of the different types of audiences that people want to share with. But ultimately, I think that humans have such a deep desire to express themselves and want to connect with the people around them that I think that all of these audiences and all of these different types of media should grow over time. And it's our job to basically make sure that we build good products and get rid of all the bugs and make it so the performance is fast, and all the basic stuff works, that way we get there. But in general, right now all the high-level trends look pretty positive on that.

I guess, also, Justin, you had a question on ad load, so I'll do both the ad load and the question on the reclassification. So on ad load, it's definitely up from where we were couple of years ago. I think it's really worth emphasizing that what has enabled us to do that is just improving the quality and the relevance of the ads that we have, and that's enabled us to show more of them without harming the user experience at all. So that's been really key. Over time, we would expect that ad load growth will be a less significant factor driving overall revenue growth, but we remain confident that we've got opportunities to continue to grow supply through the continued growth in people and engagement on Facebook as well as on our other apps such as Instagram.
