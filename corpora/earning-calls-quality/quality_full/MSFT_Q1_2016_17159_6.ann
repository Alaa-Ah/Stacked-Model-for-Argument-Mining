RgGrBz_cIR NON-ARG 623 637 Thanks, Brent.
djMcBX_Vao CLAIM-Fact 638 900 I mean that is absolutely the fact, case, that is we are seeing a much faster adoption cycle, obviously starting with the consumer side but even the 8 million business PCs that are already running Windows 10 before we have started in fact the push on enterprise.
dyJl7MQVCj CLAIM-Opinion(view) 901 1032 We expect the enterprise deployment to start in earnest the beginning of next calendar year or the second half of this fiscal year.
T80CEwGW1U PREMISE-Fact 1033 1193 But to your point, the fact that there is pull already is a very, very good indicator of, and a good sign, and it's even better than what we saw with Windows 7.
_q6sxRifNE CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1194 1330 And so to me that's all positive news, and but yet we're very, very focused on delivering I think new value to the enterprise customers.
_HITzgTXyv PREMISE-Fact 1331 1421 Because if you look at Windows 10 we've already talked a lot about all the consumer value.
fq_OR-ih-8 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1422 1652 But just take security itself, I think that Windows 10 represents a real breakthrough in terms of security on the endpoint as well as in embedded, which we are really excited about in terms of driving the enterprise upgrade cycle.
