tgFbxIyoIw NON-ARG 562 567 Sure.
bnRa1qbrz7 NON-ARG 568 678 Let me start with Q3 and this will be commentary pretty much on the whole year that was especially true in Q4.
H03oD2nnWA CLAIM-Fact 679 808 So, first of all, we've had very strong growth in some very profitable businesses that we have, most notably AWS and advertising.
E1LknmM2-g PREMISE-Statistic 925 1025 If you'll remember, we grew head count 48% in 2016 and 38% last year, if you adjust for Whole Foods.
F4vA7UbTiL PREMISE-Statistic 1026 1098 With Whole Foods, it was 66%, but without Whole Foods we still grew 38%.
PIapryruGe PREMISE-Fact 1099 1375 We have looked to really leverage our investment from the last couple years and as we've funded and moved, invested in a lot of new areas as we've talked about, AWS, devices, digital content, we've had a lot of movement within the company that has filled a lot of those roles.
vvAZ-X4oRf PREMISE-Statistic 1376 1446 So we're only up 13% on head count through nine months year-over-year.
gOT_7zyDcw PREMISE-Statistic 1599 1752 In our fulfillment center world, we had grown square footage for our fulfillment center and shipping areas by over 30% the last two years, 2016 and 2017.
jAKU_CzbLH NON-ARG 1753 1791 I've talked about that in prior calls.
oYArvrKCBg CLAIM-Fact 809 899 But we've also had great cost performance this year in three specific areas I'll call out.
Lfbspxuat2 PREMISE-Statistic 1968 2028 This year we're only adding about 15% to our square footage.
WXaeJ0YtK9 PREMISE-Statistic 2223 2286 You see the operating margin for AWS is up to 31% this quarter.
uxUeaDw12L PREMISE-Fact 2287 2456 A lot of that is based on efficiencies of our data centers, not only for the AWS business, they're also for our Amazon consumer businesses, who is AWS' biggest customer.
P7fuOTxmYK PREMISE-Statistic 2457 2644 If you look at capital leases, which is where we spend money for the data centers, it's up only 9% year-over-year, trailing 12 months, and it was up 69% last year, at the end of the year.
s6OkT7dH27 CLAIM-Reformulated 2645 2796 So those three areas have driven a lot of the cost performance and a lot of the deviation from probably the estimates that I've come up with this year.
_Sd-PKjA31 CLAIM-Reformulated 2797 2908 So we are really happy that again we're seeing great cost performance in a number of areas across the business.
F4zx94NXfu NON-ARG 1447 1475 So a real step down in that.
NUUcN02X8q CLAIM-Fact 1476 1598 Again, the theme here is going to be banking some of the investments from prior years and looking to gain greater control.
_QzUcBly2V CLAIM-Reformulated 2029 2144 So again, getting better efficiencies on what we have and banking the multi-year investment that we've been making.
4iaG1Nl-IE CLAIM-Fact 900 924 So, first on head count.
MIjH6OG8SJ CLAIM-Fact 2145 2222 And the last one, which is really significant, is on the infrastructure side.
XAvnY2f3UH CLAIM-Fact 1792 1967 Making that investment to match up with very strong Fulfilled by Amazon demand and AFN or Amazon Fulfilled Network units that are growing at a faster rate than our paid units.
