QWodYXyg2- CLAIM-Opinion(view) 649 729 On the Sports Stadium, this is an early test, but we’re pretty excited about it.
opFuAeNujU PREMISE-Statistic 730 836 We are the largest community of sports fans in the world; we have 650 million sports fans on our platform.
GDoltTVkt_ PREMISE-Fact 837 908 And people are already using Facebook to share during real-time events.
OJBsxp35z9 CLAIM-Fact 909 956 It’s an increasingly important use case for us.
CzxaKr2MNl PREMISE-Fact 957 1042 So this gives people to share, a place to share that one event and participate in it.
0eAQ8BX_Kb CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1043 1135 I think what you will see from us is always a focus on driving users and driving engagement.
Sa_m-0RX8Z PREMISE-Fact 1136 1161 This is one way to do it.
eTtfESxagS PREMISE-Fact 1162 1223 We’ll see how it works; we’re pretty open to experimentation.
hgXfeiKHNF CLAIM-Reformulated 1224 1362 So, we feel pretty confident that real-time sharing is an increasingly important part of the platform and one we’ll continue to invest in.
NIQCZs6bfi NON-ARG 1376 1396 And Paul, it’s Dave.
XoYKblFmCp NON-ARG 1397 1507 I think that question is really around sort of FX and how it relates on the revenue side versus the cost side.
i2awCZvT6b PREMISE-Fact 1508 1594 And on that front, we’re -- substantial majority of our expenses are U.S. dollar base.
YOGkledUoZ CLAIM-Fact 1595 1653 So certainly we see an impact to margins with FX headwind.
hjAmLDJL7D PREMISE-RealExample 1654 1749 So that’s just the reality of having most of our development resources for instance in the U.S.
dQz2naARlp CLAIM-Fact 1750 1854 So beyond that, we don’t do geographic cost breakouts and allocations; it’s not how we run the business.
u3fWBy14_a PREMISE-Fact 1855 1943 But certainly from an FX point of view, FX headwinds have a dampening effect on margins.
whTcnKtPz3 NON-ARG 1962 1970 Alright.
