5XbkDSpjAQ NON-ARG 1655 1659 Yes.
JeNQQDF5iN NON-ARG 1660 1678 I think it's both.
D_3RaXVXlN CLAIM-Fact 1679 1803 As I mentioned, particularly on the App Store, which is very important to us, the number of paying accounts has grown a lot.
irwNDkJX5z PREMISE-Fact 1804 2056 It's grown a lot because, as you said, the installed base has grown, but also because we have made a number of changes that have made it easier for our customers around the world to participate on the App Store and be able to transact on the App Store.
zQsYWJjUix PREMISE-RealExample 2057 2164 We are accepting, for example, more forms of payment today than we were 12 months ago or even 6 months ago.
SfLrCIEnAD NON-ARG 2165 2195 So that's been very important.
oTsyw24B3o NON-ARG 2196 2265 We also see that there is a typical spending curve for our customers.
JTgG3__-JD CLAIM-Fact 2266 2427 When they start transacting on the Store, they start at a certain level and they tend over time to get more familiar with the Store and they start to spend more.
Jf6JVYmmdx PREMISE-Fact 2428 2536 We're also now, very recently, made some changes, as you probably have seen, to the design of the App Store.
ODMlxuuCTc PREMISE-Fact 2537 2642 And I was mentioning to you in the prepared remarks that these changes have been received very favorably.
4Vn43s85VS CLAIM-Reformulated 2643 2771 And so people now are spending more time on the Store, they download more apps, and that over time translates into monetization.
K2qe8H88K1 CLAIM-Fact 2772 2865 But we also have other businesses that are growing very, very fast and actually accelerating.
b2bTLcv11P PREMISE-Fact 2866 2884 I mentioned Music.
OVRlwYn0gR PREMISE-Fact 2885 2927 I mentioned iCloud, and so it all adds up.
6J-D6PYYRA CLAIM-Reformulated 2928 2992 And as you correctly point out, our growth rate is accelerating.
JyN-lPDeSu NON-ARG 3007 3023 Thank you, Amit.
o0mkT9Nknq NON-ARG 3024 3063 Could we have the next question please?
inRrwS3rOP NON-ARG 494 498 Yes.
Wshrwgot9X PREMISE-Statistic 499 535 Amit, so we're guiding 38% to 38.5%.
zGK0fqfhPp PREMISE-Statistic 536 566 That's up 35 bps sequentially.
fJMwtRMS-a CLAIM-Fact 567 628 Obviously we're getting the leverage from the larger volumes.
pUBZXvnuPM PREMISE-Fact 629 727 As I mentioned, I think to Toni, we have higher cost structures every time we launch new products.
VZR-PHs8Of CLAIM-Fact 728 873 So that is going to be the offset, and I mentioned particularly the impact from the memory pricing environment which is a headwind at this point.
XOs-r89R9u PREMISE-Statistic 874 1001 Just to size it for you, the impact of memory on our gross margin is 40 bps sequentially and 110 bps on a year over year basis.
UQDpZpi2s2 CLAIM-Fact 1002 1096 So they are meaningful impacts, and I think that is what I think probably you're referring to.
