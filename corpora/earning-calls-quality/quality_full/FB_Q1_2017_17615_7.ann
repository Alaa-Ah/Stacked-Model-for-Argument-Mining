Gt2LGzQw1d NON-ARG 1068 1129 So, Heather, on Stories, again, it's a pretty similar answer,
EQ2DtxCUFT CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1130 1226 I think, to Ad Breaks in the sense that it's early in terms of using the ads formats in Stories.
g82u0-2uKT PREMISE-Fact 1227 1260 We've certainly rolled those out.
--rp3qYSCW PREMISE-Fact 1261 1308 They are not in the ad load calculation per se.
Z7JdKpwvQD NON-ARG 1309 1386 So it is different, as you said, from the ad load commentary that I've given.
oKZq-KhIky CLAIM-Reformulated 1387 1436 But obviously, it's very early on those products.
ijyjXAfEi2 NON-ARG 1437 1502 And then, Sheryl, you had the question about measurement metrics.
KSA-oZ7e18 CLAIM-Fact 1525 1690 Yes, we know that measurement is so critical, and we really want to measure core business results and focus on becoming the number one growth driver for our clients.
KA8LkjTXSc PREMISE-Fact 1691 1742 We are continuing to constantly review our metrics.
wrcKYAcL39 PREMISE-Fact 1743 1905 When we find bugs or errors, we're reporting them to our clients and addressing the issue and continuing with that analysis as we work through all of our metrics.
3KRNW4Npz7 CLAIM-Fact 1906 1997 We're also very focused on extending measurement partnerships and third-party verification.
KaZWgdT3mr PREMISE-RealExample 1998 2371 This last quarter we extended viewability measurement to the Audience Network, added another verification partner, DoubleVerify, for video and display measurement, and introduced our MMM [Marketing Mix Modeling] portal so that we can help people measure across all of the different platforms and compare the effectiveness of their ad spend no matter what their end goal is.
