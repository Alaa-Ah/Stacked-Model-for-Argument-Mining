r6opGi8qGo NON-ARG 615 698 Eric, why don't I take that and then Sheryl can augment with some additional color?
OO6S27LBvw CLAIM-Fact 699 785 So when you think about Instagram, we're seeing great growth there with the community.
2UTmyNT6Q_ PREMISE-Statistic 786 881 So this past quarter, we announced 700 million monthly actives, so that was a big announcement.
9DWFtK7kF7 PREMISE-Fact 882 929 And that's broad-based growth across the globe,
lc67EznPFm CLAIM-Opinion(view) 930 957 so we're pleased with that.
8SC1o0of-l CLAIM-Fact 958 1078 In terms of the development on the advertising side, we're not specifically breaking out Instagram revenue, as you know,
c8OKvTP9yE PREMISE-Fact 1079 1204 because that's sold through the same Facebook ad interfaces, but we're seeing really good contribution and good growth there.
R4gGsG7CKZ CLAIM-Fact 1205 1266 And we're developing it across a wide variety of ad products,
nyeWjtorHt PREMISE-Fact 1267 1376 so VR is becoming a more significant part of the Instagram story, where it was originally more brand-focused.
gpq1fbouUa CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1531 1600 We're pretty excited about what's happening in the Instagram ad space
9TkHKjzy_b PREMISE-Fact 1601 1679 because Facebook and Instagram are the two most important mobile ad platforms.
R4DeFBUTUu PREMISE-Fact 1680 1920 And there's a special property with Instagram, which is that the increasing visualization of ads and the creative canvas it offers with the science behind the Facebook targeting and measurement system is really a pretty unusual combination.
VMlmd3iawQ PREMISE-Fact 1921 1986 We're also seeing very broad adoption, including small customers.
wLNbtau-jA PREMISE-Statistic 1987 2097 We are pretty excited to have 1 million advertisers and 8 million Instagram business profiles on the platform.
IF3N3w2ytd PREMISE-RealExample 2098 2207 To share one example, an online store in Brazil called Loja Nama, they sell decorative items and accessories.

Av5EM4DQxH PREMISE-Statistic 2445 2525 And during the period of her campaign, Instagram accounted for 79% of her sales.
hOsKsKVqO2 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2526 2758 And I think what that shows is the power of the very sophisticated targeting we offer across our platforms along with really the ability to use very simple tools like a phone to create very sophisticated but visually compelling ads.
BigP1kTX9B PREMISE-Fact 1377 1508 But we've expanded the product offerings on the Direct Response front, and we're continuing to bring more ad products to Instagram.
