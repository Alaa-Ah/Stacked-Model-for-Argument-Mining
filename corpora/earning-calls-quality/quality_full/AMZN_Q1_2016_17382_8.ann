GabEsSS_OX NON-ARG 697 708 I'll start.
hcUjjo8Kl_ PREMISE-Statistic 709 763 I think you see the growth rate of the segment at 27%.
7wd2wKxMlu CLAIM-Fact 764 817 It's showing the success we're having with customers.
cCE3t6Q6ki CLAIM-Fact 818 879 When we grow at that clip, we can do a lot of good things it.
b1x6EBz_B_ PREMISE-Fact 880 1040 We can – on the cost side, we run our facilities more efficiently, we can buy better, we can look to in-source some things that we may have paid externally for.
