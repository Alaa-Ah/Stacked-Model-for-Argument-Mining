akTKRF1JuI NON-ARG 999 1004 Yeah.
D1nBstZ7N5 NON-ARG 1005 1038 I mean, I'll take the second one.
vEqWlc7N8Q CLAIM-Reformulated 1314 1360 And that's where I think the opportunity lies.
PIYhQXfnA6 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1039 1253 I think that, yes, I mean, Cosmos DB's pretty unique capability in combination with everything else we do in both the data layer, the AI layer and the infrastructure layer, I think we have a tremendous opportunity,
WBqOtzKjbf PREMISE-Fact 1254 1313 because, as I said, this AI era is mostly first a data era.
xrifDU4-HB PREMISE-Fact 1361 1568 But to your previous question, even there, there are multiple trends here, and Amy referenced it in her remarks, which is for example, virtualization still continues to be a growth driver of server products.
Umc_Ljr0ho PREMISE-Fact 1569 1667 The other growth driver of server products is cybersecurity and the security value in our servers.
QXQ_xSdobV PREMISE-Fact 1668 1682 So that's one.
myziAigjJT PREMISE-RealExample 1683 1786 The fact that we now have SQL and, for example, when you think about SQL itself, it's a hybrid product.
vdoVJiP4lR PREMISE-RealExample 1787 1829 You can tier SQL databases with the cloud.
vzxiY12MIH PREMISE-Fact 1830 1980 SQL is an AI product because we have the one database that actually allows you to write Python and R in situ, store procedures right in your database.
Rqq_J6CEBS PREMISE-RealExample 1981 2096 So, for example, when we talk about data and AI close to data, because computation will always go wherever data is.
PsdleQwhdo PREMISE-RealExample 2097 2190 And a lot of data shows up in relational databases and we have a growth driver there as well.
GLLZQXUqWy PREMISE-RealExample 2191 2418 And then there is the hybrid choices, where if somebody's building a smart factory, they're now looking and saying, what is the server I deploy in the factory to manage the millions of sensors that are there across the factory.
MWQMWeBNOW PREMISE-Fact 2419 2457 And that's where Azure Stack shows up.
exQw0Z-2yi CLAIM-Fact 2458 2544 So multiple drivers of what is essentially the server and cloud number in combination.
wlQfQrnVdl CLAIM-Fact 2558 2744 And to your point on the component, the on-prem component, even with comparable doing well, let me break Satya's comment into sort of two drivers that have been actually more sustaining.
syIpIz1suO PREMISE-Fact 2745 2872 And it's across both Windows in particular, but also SQL, which are obviously the largest products within our server portfolio.
6z7SqPjN_Z PREMISE-Fact 2873 2910 The first exactly with hybrid demand.
ReZ7e9Mkk- PREMISE-Fact 2911 2958 We have something called Azure Hybrid Benefits.
FR4YAnzsHh PREMISE-Fact 2959 3197 What it does is really provide confidence to our committed customers buying on-prem servers that their transition to a hybrid, to cloud over a period of their agreement, is really about their choices, their timelines and their confidence.
KBZND92pSP PREMISE-Fact 3198 3338 And so, with that right, it lets them easily transition between Windows or SQL to those same benefits in Azure with a small uplift in price.
GS4wyoSW4J CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3339 3387 I think that has actually been a core component.
ntqg4twMDX PREMISE-Fact 3388 3508 The second one was the virtualization drive or data center modernization, another one, do move the premium mix up a bit.
5-mdR9PCgW CLAIM-Fact 3509 3642 So that's, if you wanted to break it down into two more sustaining things, those are the types of things we're seeing in that number.
IhKBYsGwcX NON-ARG 3659 3666  Great.
mgOIunyHIL NON-ARG 3667 3674 Thanks.
oFhhJREElk NON-ARG 3675 3710 And this will be our last question.
