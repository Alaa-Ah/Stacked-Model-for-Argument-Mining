SjgIV8a06O NON-ARG 1055 1100 Let me make sure I cover of on most of those.
xQf1CnALE- CLAIM-Fact 1101 1239 Let me start by saying, the biggest driver in commercial bookings growth this quarter was excellent execution on a large base of renewals.
hxJcjWBRXM CLAIM-Fact 1240 1427 The second component of that is the execution on new revenue; in particular Azure, as well as Windows commercial, and billings in the quarter were very good and quite encouraging overall.
9YJmxDLV4e PREMISE-Fact 1428 1563 There was no change in any way to invoicing people paying earlier, paying more upfront, thatâ€™s definitely not an impact on that number.
XHdvVCAhjm CLAIM-Fact 1564 1864 And so overall, I think while it is certainly aided by the large expiry base because it tends to impact the CNB balance the most, it is really I think to your point; it is clearly encouraging because it gives us a very good base of support going into FY 2018 to come in to the GAAP reporting numbers.
