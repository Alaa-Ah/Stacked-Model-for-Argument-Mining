F0OCNdEDw- NON-ARG 727 732 Sure.
p3ZJbdshkF NON-ARG 733 742 Hi, Eric.
slu2bk1TPy CLAIM-Opinion(view) 743 835 Yes, let me make clear, we are really excited and looking forward to a great holiday season.
-nvwkY90lq CLAIM-Opinion(view) 836 928 We feel like we had a great Q3 as well and have made rapid progress on our One Day shipping.
Lpv7llBDO5 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 929 1082 The ops team has done a great job getting us to a position where we are in and I think that’s going to be a great additional service for customers in Q4.
EbyXr0ihiH NON-ARG 1084 1149 On the guidance front, here’s what I would have you keep in mind.
3br3qNgD8S PREMISE-Fact 1150 1301 If you look back over the last few years and adjust for the acquisition of Whole Foods and Soup, which obscured this a bit in the last couple of years.
C9kaXZ4ior PREMISE-Statistic 1303 1416 There has been a noticeable drop in run rate, between Q3 and Q4 generally on the lines of about 300 basis points.
0xSD2Q-Ap9 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1417 1491 We are factoring that in this year, that’s just something we’re expecting.
CZeHLjRzzP PREMISE-Statistic 2231 2360 I would say it has helped us by 150 basis points in Q3, and will be a negative headwind of 300 basis points year-over-year in Q4.
RpeOlURA6Q PREMISE-Statistic 2407 2520 There is about 40 basis points of favorability in Q3 and it’s expected to be about 80 basis point headwind in Q4.
mX_K3fHFT- CLAIM-Reformulated 2521 2612 So that’s a little bit more on our guidance, but again we are really looking forward to Q4.
TsU8cBsFrl CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2614 2695 I think we’re well positioned to make it the best holiday ever for our customers.
nzo3OI5tnN CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2696 2746 I think One Day should help with holiday shipping.
Fjot62VD_- PREMISE-Fact 1492 1668 It’s a bit about the law of large numbers and the differential between growth and holiday season, that’s very tight few weeks of the holiday season versus the rest of the year.
P27L8M4I8f CLAIM-Fact 1670 1731 So we factor that in, and then there’s also two other issues.
KGBdjVZ04t PREMISE-RealExample 1732 1820 The Diwali holiday in India was all in Q4 last year and a bit of it was in Q3 this year.
DGgNsbAxhk PREMISE-RealExample 1821 2118 Also the Japan consumption tax was raised from 8% to 10% on October 1, and what we saw was a pre-buy a bit in Q3 at the end of the quarter, and based on our history with the last time the consumption tax went up many years ago, we’ve expected a slight negative impact from that tax in Q4 in Japan.
TaP3SgWtbe CLAIM-Reformulated 2120 2230 So if you wrap those together, we expect it’s going to be more of an issue with our international growth rate.
LjzqOjGNfe CLAIM-Fact 2362 2406 For the company, it’s not as large an issue.
aXjfVGiV67 CLAIM-Fact 2747 2959 We’ve got a great new device lineup you may have seen announced in September and on the AWS side, we’re looking forward to our re:Invent Conference in Las Vegas, where we welcome over 65,000 conference attendees.
