m4rQKZm9aU NON-ARG 692 703 I’ll start.
wKpPZ9mgc0 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 704 762 I think as far as the low-cost devices, it’s pretty broad.
JUAh3q7kMc PREMISE-RealExample 763 869 I think we think of the U.S. itself being in fact a big driver of some of the growth on the consumer side.
KB7_mtRZQF PREMISE-Fact 870 989 We’re also obviously – stimulated this so that we can be much more effective even in the educational markets worldwide.
LaIcyX5Aov NON-ARG 990 1046 And Amy can add to that if we had any more detail on it.
7A6KtVJEAT CLAIM-Fact 1047 1292 When it comes to our Commercial Licensing and our servers, it’s the same trend, Heather, which is the big shift that’s happening is our enterprise and datacenter products, being Windows Server, Systems Centers , SQL Server, are more competitive.
NQx3BLYTTy PREMISE-Fact 1392 1492 There is clearly – and in fact, as our products have become competitive there’s been this mix shift.
-1dVD6EMxz PREMISE-Fact 1293 1391 It’s the same thing that I would say at least in the last couple of years clearly have played out.
ciWGP-uCNS PREMISE-Fact 1493 1632 People have bought from us previously just standard editions are able to now look at our enterprise editions and that’s what’s playing out.
AYFxqpGrUt NON-ARG 1938 1960 So that’s what we see.
lI1Uhl-Bdk CLAIM-Fact 1633 1696 And there’s definitely some pricing action we were able to take
rxsEjhkvSR PREMISE-Fact 1698 1764 but mostly because we were able to deliver this incremental value.
Ez0bOyojlA PREMISE-Fact 1765 1937 And even with all the pricing action we took, we, from a total cost of ownership or just raw pricing perspective are very competitive versus what’s available in the market.
jDhag_rtqq PREMISE-Fact 1961 2191 And so the cycle some of the pricing actions obviously were anniversary out, but the overall thing that I’m focused on is how can we continue to run our software asset ourselves in public cloud and translate that into our servers.
Y-_hWuSxV5 NON-ARG 2192 2300 And really paint this vision and make it a reality of hybrid computing and drive the secular growth of that.
kKYnBdpEmD NON-ARG 2310 2327  Thanks, Heather.
jNzRDkNJFw NON-ARG 2338 2385  We’ll have time for one more question, please.
