tr4YreOCle PREMISE-Fact 1205 1392 But really some of the other upside that we saw in the quarter was from things that are the second sort of derivative of that, which was our search results were better than we had thought
D5qKNlzsyB PREMISE-Fact 1394 1502 Because of some of these results about where the PCs were upgraded and the pace at which they were upgraded.
VrOkaPEwCU CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1503 1554 And so I do think we are encouraged, as Satya said.
hEDAlQAx2V CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1777 1922 And then the next stage after that which is really the enterprise deployment, which as Satya mentioned, we expect in the second half of the year.
Tyc1jX4d0j NON-ARG 644 657 Thanks, Karl.
AvEIahAVq9 NON-ARG 658 698 Why don't I take that and Satya can add.
_0R10YPlnP CLAIM-Fact 699 866 In particular what we saw this quarter was really as much about the mix of the devices that the OEMs are bringing to market as it was in the absolute unit distinction.
Jx4SPHZlIF PREMISE-Fact 867 919 And you saw that in the non-Pro revenue performance.
g8JdH8z18u PREMISE-Other 920 1204 And so for us I think really the way to think about the early signs of the impact were the strong device mix, some higher priced units across a wide variety of OEMs as we build into holiday, did provide some slightly better than expected results, as you noted in the non-Pro business.
tKNYJJI5MI NON-ARG 1555 1578 But we're a quarter in.
_BsXlHFGxc CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1579 1662 And I think what's exciting for us is really the opportunity we have going forward.
BrCzEsKLsE CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1663 1719 We're excited about Q2 when the devices hit the shelves.
VAOWtk2kHe CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1720 1776 We're excited to have so many first party devices in Q2.
Mpzm0WT7xI CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1923 2018 So it's early, but you're right, we did see some incremental improvement over what we expected.
