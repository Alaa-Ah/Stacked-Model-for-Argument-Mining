wtdbbqhyaJ NON-ARG 439 450 Sure thing.
MQAWBmQcPS NON-ARG 451 483 Thanks for your questions, Gene.
sklQ8LM5cm NON-ARG 484 611 On robotics first, we don't have any new numbers to share with you, but we're super excited with the progress of that business.
aakEWJ5bqz NON-ARG 612 795 We had very high expectations for Amazon Robotics and its impact on our warehouse cost structure and we have been very pleasantly surprised by the job being done on that by that team.
eo5Hd0JzFM NON-ARG 796 821 So that's looking great. 
AOZassaXLp NON-ARG 821 837 Efficiency, yes.
mejPiOGzjD NON-ARG 838 944 As we've talked about in the last few calls we have even more emphasis on variable and fixed productivity.
uRbS_BGldz NON-ARG 945 1008 I think that's evident in the Q2 results that you've just seen.
1V_r5LM92S NON-ARG 1009 1087 To give you a little more color on that, I would say what does that look like?
3PF8EeT9Q6 NON-ARG 1088 1303 We have defect reduction and process improvements are probably something we've always done and worked on, both to lower our cost but also to improve the customer experience and also the seller and vendor experience.
rHzS-Hce_M NON-ARG 1304 1518 We're using software and algorithms to make decisions rather than people, which we think it's more efficient and scales better and will be more accurate, especially as we insert machine learning into the decisions.
KbFBjlNfDR NON-ARG 1519 1621 As I said earlier we benefit from the efficiency gains of the AWS business on the Amazon site as well.
QWz3sWo_ZN NON-ARG 1622 1903 We look to increase the leverage of our fixed assets, particularly our fulfillment centers and the throughput of the fulfillment centers, and just generally getting inventory closer to customers as we add and expand warehouses in the sort centers that we added primarily last year.
ZwibYV-Tw0 NON-ARG 1904 2015 All have helped our cost structure, so just a little more color on maybe some specifics on the efficiency area.
