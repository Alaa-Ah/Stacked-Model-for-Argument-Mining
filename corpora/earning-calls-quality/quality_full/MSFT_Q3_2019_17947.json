In terms of overall reach of Office 365, we continue to see significant opportunity going forward on multiple dimensions.

So, now that with a SaaS approach, you can reach a much broader base of business customers all over the world, is one opportunity. The second opportunity is, if you look at Teams, as an example, we are now reaching a lot of first-line workers. So this is whether it's in healthcare, whether it's in manufacturing, whether it's in retail, just not knowledge workers, but where you now have messaging solutions, as well as business process workflows integrated. So it's that combination of things going from knowledge workers to first-line going and the ability to reach all sizes of businesses is what's going to continue to help us I think have overall seat growth or socket growth.
