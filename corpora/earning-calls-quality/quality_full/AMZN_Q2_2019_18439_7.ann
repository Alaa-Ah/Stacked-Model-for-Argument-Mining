0gkWRP-37e NON-ARG 774 778 Yes.
3y4raJFwCw NON-ARG 779 951 So, I would say the first time we started discussing the rollout of one-day our first thoughts went to Q4 this year and our capability for holiday and as much as Q2 and Q3.
skF1XsS-As CLAIM-Opinion(view) 952 1028 So we are confident that we will have the ability to handle seasonal demand.
Ky4kD4KzE4 PREMISE-Fact 1333 1376 It was the two biggest days we've ever had.
3uLrbrlkzN CLAIM-Fact 1238 1332 It's a little early to discuss that now, but we certainly had a really good test on Prime Day.
cLvjAz34R- PREMISE-Other 1377 1529 A lot of good work went into Prime Day, a lot of benefit for customers, a lot of benefit for our selling partners, the small business merchants as well.
anay0FvBjz CLAIM-Reformulated 1530 1559 So it was a good test for us.
4f0coBXtjc PREMISE-Other 1029 1205 We are working very hard to expand our one-day capacity, add carriers, add delivery partners at our own AMZL capability and have our partners expand their capabilities as well.
