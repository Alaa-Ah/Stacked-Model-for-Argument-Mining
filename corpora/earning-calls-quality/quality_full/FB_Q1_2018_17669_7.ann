rcaji6s7cP CLAIM-Fact 477 584 So for Watch, the big thing that we're trying to do is help create new ways that people can connect, right?
VHB_jEg_dX NON-ARG 585 756 So it's very different from video and News Feed, the passive consumption that I'm talking about on response to some of the other questions because it's intentional, right?
dY1YRcVYbi NON-ARG 757 807 I mean, people go to it to watch specific content.
YZ-bGSxwYS CLAIM-Reformulated 808 998 And we're trying to make a different experience than what you might be able to get on YouTube or any of these other services by making it more about connecting with people in different ways.
sS6Hw9kccH PREMISE-RealExample 999 1190 So a good example of this is what I talked about with Watch Party, where now people â€“ groups of people can get together and can watch videos at the same time and you can interact around that.
gLlY3WcE0w PREMISE-Fact 1191 1367 And we think that that's the kind of experience that we can uniquely build and that that's going to further our mission and just be a unique thing that we can add to the world.
WnhXxFddHL PREMISE-Fact 1368 1495 So what we're seeing so far is that a bunch of the content that has come onto Watch is good and is working and people watch it.
ym83RyejKE PREMISE-Fact 1496 1618 We're continuing to treat the product to emphasize that kind of content more while building more of these social features.
pRmmrkd7jq NON-ARG 1619 1822 I'd say it's still pretty early overall in terms of the growth of this, but it's clearly an area that's important where I think we have something unique that we're going to bring to make this successful.
