32iiM6koyj CLAIM-Opinion(view) 458 549 It's really as we talked about transactional weakness in Productivity and Business Process.
92ttotQKiG CLAIM-Reformulated 746 873 So really in that segment, it's the PC weakness in our traditional transactional Office business that's impacting that segment.
hEj8cihVXm PREMISE-Other 1241 1329 And in More Personal Computing, the largest change in that segment is frankly the phone.
2N3oj5WiFn CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1330 1377 So I would really focus on that in that segment
rEUZV9YoBr NON-ARG 1379 1418 The rest of it, frankly, is quite good.

UwBs0_rMzr CLAIM-Opinion(view) 600 653 We're continuing to expect a strong mix to the cloud.
tF-p2oAoCF CLAIM-Opinion(view) 654 745 We're continuing to expect ARPU increases, premium mix increases and installed base growth.

Cb8gK3gmxh CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1043 1240 We're expecting annuity double-digit revenue growth and again it's the transactional weakness that you're seeing overall as well as the very specific geo weakness we saw which I called out earlier.
