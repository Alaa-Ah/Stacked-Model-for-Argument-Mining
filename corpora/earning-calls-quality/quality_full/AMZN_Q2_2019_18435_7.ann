AteXeXa8RO NON-ARG 689 701 Hi, Youssef.
bih-Zkv7-- NON-ARG 702 740 Let me start your question on one-day.
yfwAOzzV3h CLAIM-Fact 937 976 So we're always working within a range.
CDsE1ufgul NON-ARG 1786 1790 Yes.
-hA0BsSKuf NON-ARG 1791 1823 And then just on Sizmek quickly.
_MAPW82tTv CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1824 1932 We are excited to have acquired the Sizmek ad server and then Sizmek's dynamic creative optimization or DCO.
AHkfnGK203 CLAIM-Fact 1933 2018 Customers are going to be able to continue to use those proven products and services.
5b-C9ldnvW CLAIM-Fact 2019 2069 We're invested in the long-term success of Sizmek.
BSQvHXY_WP CLAIM-Fact 2210 2364 So we're looking forward to work with that team and we'll share more updates as we invent and create new opportunities to serve advertisers in the future.
I62gwMcsW1 PREMISE-Fact 2070 2209 And again, Amazon advertising and Sizmek has many mutual customers, so we know how valued these prudent solutions are to the customer base.
-TAQvwELyC PREMISE-Statistic 977 1055 We're confidently we were near but just above our $800 million estimate in Q2.
n5wnhl_-wY PREMISE-Fact 1124 1219 We had a meaningful step up in North America in Q2 and it was accelerating through the quarter.
jV5pzFJyfC CLAIM-Fact 1220 1246 We'll see more cost in Q3.
bPIUFI2zWx CLAIM-Fact 1247 1358 We'll see about Q4 when we talk and everything we know about or anticipate about Q3 is built into our guidance.
hwE2-dCbTz NON-ARG 741 828 I'm not breaking out the specific cost this quarter as I did last year -- last quarter.
dfjbjZYFf_ NON-ARG 829 936 Some of this is because it's very hard to pinpoint exactly the lines between one-day and other cost issues.
aAO7z-8uh6 NON-ARG 1056 1123 And as I said, this is going to take multiple quarters to play out.
n1iMsIw1TC CLAIM-Reformulated 1359 1399 So I wouldn't break out the dollar term.
vTQfWObzQR CLAIM-Fact 1400 1508 I will tell you at the end of the quarter kind of what we're seeing on cost and how it looks for Q4 as well.
ks9RNONvoW CLAIM-Fact 1509 1772 And the other thing I would point out on the trajectory is that, we're just getting started in international and most of that work is ahead of us although the speed that tick up a bit in Q1 -- excuse me Q2 but -- and will do even more so in Q3 in future quarters.
