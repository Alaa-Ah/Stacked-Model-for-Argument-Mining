emVTYFWtld CLAIM-Opinion(view) 672 960 So, Peter, just on the â€“ on ads engagement, that's an area that we've obviously been very focused on, and we're really pleased with the results that we're seeing there in terms of driving better engagement per ad, and that's really the focus of a lot of our quality and relevance efforts.
ghFRTqzwez CLAIM-Reformulated 1131 1366 We're working on focusing on all of those, on optimizing the relevance of the ads for all of those different potential actions that happen downstream and we're pleased with what we're doing there and the trends that we're seeing there.
