I0rfu4O_NG PREMISE-Statistic 1845 2120 so as we mentioned, the ASP for iPhone was up $99, 18% increase year-over-year and this is really driven by the mix, by the fact that we've added iPhone 6 Plus to a new price point and in general, iPhone 6 and 6 Plus are doing extremely well as a percentage of the portfolio.
Gr6fuhRYET CLAIM-Fact 2445 2578 Those are markets where our growth rates are particularly strong and the 6 Plus, because of the screen size, is doing extremely well.
iicGWgvJfO NON-ARG 357 368 Definitely.
FxccJtSYQz NON-ARG 369 382 This is Luca.
zZQzYpiDor NON-ARG 383 515 So we got into 38.5% to 39.5%, and so just keep in mind last year in Q4, our gross margin declined by 140 basis points sequentially.
AWslnnKiLj NON-ARG 516 586 So this year we're expecting a sequential decline of 220 basis points.
QnXkOhIDxh NON-ARG 587 639 I would point to three main factors for the decline.
d1vimiP0tW CLAIM-Fact 1089 1178 And so those are the three factors that will have an impact on gross margin sequentially.
0b7dwAZ9Cp PREMISE-Fact 640 779 First of all, to your point around foreign exchange, it continues to be a challenging environment given the strengthening of the US dollar.
5aH5x7EHJc PREMISE-Fact 876 1002 Also, I want to point to a different mix, which is typical of our seasonality as we enter the back-to-school season during Q4.
EXNUsedEXa PREMISE-Fact 1003 1088 And thirdly, the transition cost that you've mentioned as we prepare for a busy fall.
Zn9A_KFwYo NON-ARG 780 875 In our case, the impact on margin after the hedges is going to be about 30 basis points for Q4.
cp114OT3Cj CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1289 1356 so there would be a partial offset to the factors that I mentioned.
nWYCq0EO6f PREMISE-Other 1179 1288 I would point that in general costs continue to be, particularly commodity costs continue to be favorable and
2eu-hJAEeL PREMISE-Hypothesis 2213 2255 So the number would have been even better.
QiNZRY1l6e PREMISE-Statistic 2121 2212 And keep in mind that this $99 was partially offset by $24 of unfavorable foreign exchange.
mdLsgL-5xA CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2286 2444 And I think we talked about it in prior calls, the 6 Plus is doing particularly well in the markets that you would expect, Greater China, other Asian markets.
h4KtFNDDsT NON-ARG 2256 2285 So yes, clearly 6 and 6 Plus.
FxrMdAGBCy NON-ARG 1838 1845  Yeah,
