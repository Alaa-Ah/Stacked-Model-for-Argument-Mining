cBW6i0MO7n NON-ARG 4024 4079 Jim, let me just add a couple things to that for color.
CgBtlqWkm8 CLAIM-Fact 4080 4253 Our installed base is growing at double digit, and that's probably a much more significant metric for us from an ecosystem point of view and the customer loyalty, et cetera.
_1g5qMo0Sc NON-ARG 4254 4423 The second thing is this is a little bit like if you go to the market and you push your cart up to the cashier and she says, or he says how many units you have in there?
S9eyBu_HJI NON-ARG 4424 4534 It doesn't matter a lot how many units there are in there in terms of the overall value of what's in the cart.
xk8y6TiK0k NON-ARG 2214 2258 And, Jim, let me take the question on units.
dHUg01kx40 NON-ARG 2259 2353 First of all, as Tim said, our approach to guidance, providing guidance doesn't change at all.
in4D0AhCL- CLAIM-Fact 2354 2424 We continue to provide the same metrics that we were providing before.
-nIP_FOZ7k CLAIM-Fact 2425 2574 In terms of reporting results, one of the things that we are doing, and it's new and it's in addition to the information that we provide to investors
otXnRqoWmr PREMISE-Fact 2575 2830 because we've heard some significant level of interest around this, is starting with the December quarter, for the first time we're going to be providing information on revenue and cost of sales, and therefore gross margins for both products and services.
W1XDnnk9ef NON-ARG 2831 3011 And this will be the first time that we're going to provide gross margin information for our services business, which we believe is an important metric for our investors to follow.
_5WB1z40Ny PREMISE-RealExample 3329 3675 To give you an example, the unit sales of iPhone at the top end of the line have been very strong during the September quarter, and that's very important because we're attracting customers to the most recent technologies and features and innovation that we bring into the lineup, but you don't necessarily see that in the number that is reported.
O7-TPBqIxo CLAIM-Reformulated 3676 3785 And so therefore, we will, as I said, we'll provide qualitative commentary when it is important and relevant.
Ipj-0ywsOV CLAIM-Reformulated 3786 4002 But at the end of the day, we make our decisions from a financial standpoint to try and optimize our revenue and our gross margin dollars, and that we think is the focus that is in the best interest of our investors.
SlNrYhK171 CLAIM-Fact 3243 3328 But as I said earlier, a unit of sale is less relevant today than it was in the past.
gIbPv51lJA CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3012 3242 Given the rationale on why we do not believe that providing unit sales is particularly relevant for our company at this point, I can reassure you that it is our objective to grow unit sales for every product category that we have.
ub7gpR78de NON-ARG 1055 1083 Okay, I'll start with India.
c13dou_HqE CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1084 1262 We've had really great productive discussions with the Indian government, and I fully expect that at some point, they will agree to allow us to bring our stores into the country.
j7EwncG37z CLAIM-Reformulated 1263 1341 We've been in discussions with them, and the discussions are going quite well.
c_PdZ41ug_ NON-ARG 1342 1440 As you point out, there are import duties in some or most of the product categories that we're in.
CKRy0bWA7j NON-ARG 1441 1529 In some cases, they compound, and this is an area that we're giving lots of feedback on.
esDVVWv6P3 CLAIM-Fact 1530 1615 We do manufacture some of the entry iPhones in India, and that project has gone well.
_SZv8QXLwA CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1616 1645 I am a big believer in India.
1T--heKuLJ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1646 1727 I am very bullish on the country and the people and our ability to do well there.
jvU6JAn0uE CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1913 1966 And the long term I think is very, very strong there.
jG0_YFhvrB PREMISE-Fact 1967 2036 There's a huge number of people that will move into the middle class.
-bgkR-VR8a NON-ARG 2037 2126 The government has really focused on reform in a major way and made some very bold moves.
tjsNBBlSvF NON-ARG 2127 2199 And I applaud them for doing that and I can't wait for the future there.
HFZz1HLR8H CLAIM-Fact 1728 1912 The currency weakness has been part of our challenge there, as you can tell from just looking at the currency trends, but I view these as speed bumps along a very long journey, though.
