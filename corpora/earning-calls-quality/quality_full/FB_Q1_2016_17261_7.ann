yklWpXMgZ1 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1015 1061 We think our growth has been very broad-based,
HUUMP6ZGtK PREMISE-Fact 1062 1162 but dollars are shifting from all types of media formats to where consumers are spending their time.
vazQIxExKR CLAIM-Reformulated 1374 1395 but it's broad-based.
8CQrmgi2qZ NON-ARG 1163 1284 We tell our clients that we want to be the best dollar and the best minute they spend, and we want them to measure value.
IfEp6PwmfX NON-ARG 1285 1373 I don't think this means that all of our growth comes at the expense of any one channel,
C69uxI1YAU CLAIM-Fact 1396 1467 And often, TV and Facebook and Instagram can work really well together.
3ydi4DNe4a NON-ARG 1468 1512 I'll give a fun example from the Super Bowl.
7YaaZkoDxQ PREMISE-RealExample 1513 1621 T-Mobile wanted to use their Super Bowl campaign to increase their brand awareness and increase their reach.
dfZ5tF9gJQ PREMISE-RealExample 1622 1749 So before the game, they targeted their 30-second Super Bowl ad that featured Drake to people with NFL and celebrity interests.
bqkKX2Qk7R PREMISE-Fact 1750 1844 It performed so well that they decided to run the 60-second version on Facebook and Instagram.
bu0oHFkW0I PREMISE-Fact 1845 1969 That ad was so successful on Facebook and Instagram that they then ran the 60-second ad on TV instead of their 30-second ad.
MKdsdP4MIC NON-ARG 1970 2086 So as people invest, they can use these different platforms together, and we're pretty excited to see that progress.
3G8HJ-abhQ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2111 2309 And on Live video, the theme that I think is most important is just that there's so much that people want to express and share with the people around them that they don't have the tools to do today.
25qhu1vfxi CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2310 2423 And I think about this huge opportunity, not just in Live video, but in a lot of things that we're talking about.
EZbFZZTtkS PREMISE-Statistic 2424 2557 One interesting example recently that I touched on earlier is between Messenger and WhatsApp, we're around 60 billion messages a day.
XHUdH3Zvxc PREMISE-Statistic 2558 2624 And SMS at its peak we think was around 20 billion messages a day.
jmXUkzt4Ad PREMISE-Fact 2625 2812 And just unlocking some of the friction that existed in SMS and improving the product a little bit and removing the small fee that was there has just unlocked a huge amount of expression.
Lkgmxpqbdc PREMISE-Other 2813 2959 And we think that this is going to be the case in all different types of media and with all different audiences that a person would share it with.
wMwV_cUX-Y CLAIM-Fact 3087 3335 The reason why we give disproportionate attention to it is because we're trying to help push forward new formats that are not just about consuming content but are really about interacting, so Live, 360 video, and there will be others in the future.
GmODwcITzx NON-ARG 3336 3458 And so yes, to answer your question, I do think that multiple products and companies can succeed in building these things.
ymOuQawkUe NON-ARG 3459 3589 I also think that there are going to be a lot more interactive forms of video than just Live and 360 like we're talking about now.
GZOH1RK4AE CLAIM-Reformulated 3713 3839 So we're very excited about continuing to do our work to help unlock all the expression and connection that people want to do.
cXgxlhlba1 NON-ARG 3590 3712 And I think that this extends not just to video but for all the different types of media and audiences that we're serving.
MdBOGLyOMC NON-ARG 2960 3053 So in video, there are billions and billions of videos that are viewed every day on Facebook.
n-2k4g5zcA NON-ARG 3054 3086 Live is a very small part of it.
vVsXlAKMqx NON-ARG 3857 3889  Thank you for joining us today.
