ZhGDeEjYxk NON-ARG 695 700 Yeah.
dLhbCoWkri NON-ARG 701 726 I'll take a few of those.
PzjkNnQZ2K CLAIM-Fact 727 789 So on elections, we run a very large and diversified business.
C1_vZ4ofMz PREMISE-Fact 790 989 So there are these events that are obviously big like the U.S. elections, the World Cup, Super Bowl, but there are enough of these all around the world that no one event is that big for our business.
4FR6o_QbZx PREMISE-Fact 990 1088 Even last quarter, political spending even within the U.S. alone was not a top-10 vertical for us.
VQ_wy-H5nT CLAIM-Fact 1089 1193 When you think about ads in Messenger, we right now are really focused on consumer growth and engagement
Xsf3wyc69r PREMISE-Fact 1194 1267 because we know that over time that creates the monetization opportunity.
f4Em90aevF PREMISE-Fact 1268 1343 We're seeing a lot of organic connections between businesses and consumers.
oZ4ZcUlY5i CLAIM-Reformulated 1699 1799 But right now, we're going to remain focused on user experience and the experimentation we're doing.
7XJM7Myy36 PREMISE-Statistic 1344 1421 We're now per month at a billion messages sent between people and businesses,
RyeRj53vor CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1422 1581 and we think that's very promising for our ability for people to use this platform to make those connections that will ultimately drive business opportunities.
Kk2lM0JsJX PREMISE-Fact 1582 1698 We're in the very early stages, some of those ads you're seeing of exploring how to build more of these connections.
vqUWcfYZGA NON-ARG 1817 1822 Yeah.
hKzzLKHCuw NON-ARG 1823 1980 And Justin, just adding to the question on elections, I'd also point out that our reported daily active and monthly active numbers reflect usage in December.
Ck2sJF5_bu NON-ARG 1981 2105 So even for the U.S. that doesn't really pick up the election period just because of the way that we tabulate those results.
aPgdoxTss1 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2106 2147 On Millennials, we were really pleased â€“ 
IEqBa_MjZ2 PREMISE-Fact 2147 2311 this was a fantastic quarter for overall growth of the Facebook community, our strongest absolute MAU and DAU additions year-over-year since being a public company,
Fitdr2C3_K CLAIM-Reformulated 2312 2340 so really pleased with that.
reF_5gDXFT PREMISE-Fact 2341 2471 So within that context, we're not breaking out specific cohorts, but we remain a great place for advertisers to reach Millennials.
l5UanRyNTU PREMISE-Fact 2472 2540 And Instagram is obviously another great place to reach Millennials,
d00_dRnmuh CLAIM-Fact 2541 2647 and we continue to build our products to serve a wide variety of audiences, including Millennials as well.
