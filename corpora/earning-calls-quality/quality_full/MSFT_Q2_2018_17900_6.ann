8Pbn7LiY8S NON-ARG 713 735 I'll actually let Amy.
Q4kerTWRBh NON-ARG 746 774 Yeah, why don't I take this.
pn3xr7l_xa CLAIM-Fact 775 905 Number one I would say, we have - when we have seen an opportunity to invest, we have not really waited for tax reform to do that.
YUZ_GPhQop PREMISE-Fact 906 1057 Our opportunity, the TAM, really the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is really the technical transition and digital transformation that's occurring now.
k5vl2aIjWy PREMISE-Fact 1058 1101 And so, we've invested to make that happen.
7MvXfwZJSO PREMISE-Fact 1102 1144 We made acquisitions when they made sense.
XZ37tFAYAi PREMISE-Fact 1145 1281 We have used the capital markets and the debt market to fund those to make sure that we made the right investments to grow our business.
awB0IgUXSQ PREMISE-Other 1282 1354 And so for us, we also didn't wait when we thought about capital return.
_FPP_ojs6c PREMISE-Fact 1355 1464 Even this quarter, we returned almost all of our free cash flow generation in dividends and share repurchase.
Jfh7prvboM PREMISE-Fact 1465 1515 And we've been on that path for a number of years.
GPm0KUs7ME PREMISE-Fact 1516 1678 Now, that being said, I am pleased obviously, to be able to access the cash more easily and not has to go through the debt market to be able to make these choices
TfsUwFEi7x PREMISE-Other 1680 1869 Whether it's investment in ourselves, and the returns you've seen in this quarter in revenue growth, whether it's the acquisitions like LinkedIn that are performing better than we expected.
Hi043T5NL7 PREMISE-Fact 1870 2043 And I think today, we would even say it's a more strategic asset than we even maybe thought a year ago in terms of the power of it to add to our graph and our understanding.
MNR457o05O PREMISE-Fact 2044 2080 And then, be able to return capital.
07frOunDsS PREMISE-Other 2081 2265 So for me, while I appreciate the spirit behind the question, for us we have felt a necessity to do that for years, as a part of total shareholder return and our commitment to do that.
FKaGi-6J96 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2266 2300 And I think we've done a good job.
GgMam1HK8b CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2301 2392 And I'm proud of what we've done, and I'm proud and excited for what we can continue to do.
