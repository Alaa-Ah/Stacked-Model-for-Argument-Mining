XhlrX1hhJM CLAIM-Fact 652 851 On the video question, we're basically focused primarily on video on our own site and service, and video tends to be pretty short form content right now on Facebook because it's playing in News Feed.
QJlpXchenz PREMISE-Fact 852 912 We do see some pretty cool examples of people using it well.
RdUZtfrP36 PREMISE-RealExample 913 1056 So for example, in the election, you saw Hillary Clinton announce her candidacy very recently, obviously, and that video got 2.7 million views.
u1rYIaieUH PREMISE-RealExample 1057 1144 Ted Cruz and others have done the same and they've gotten large numbers of video views.
2z3kFVr7sy PREMISE-Other 1145 1236 So we think it's a very attractive platform for people to reach people with video messages.
