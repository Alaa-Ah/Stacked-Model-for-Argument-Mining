ZSei5WggD0 NON-ARG 1355 1575 In terms of our future plans, I wouldn't want to comment about any particular thing, but obviously, with breaking this out, we wouldn't be breaking it out if it wasn't an area that was very important to us in the future.
tey7UeyHal NON-ARG 767 785 So, good question.
gMoAuaEG4U CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1179 1354 I do think that the assets that we have in this area are huge and I do think that it's probably something that the investment community would want to and should focus more on.

JEoF4fgqzm NON-ARG 2176 2282 No, I don't -- honestly, this has nothing to do with wanting to move customers from one person to another.
