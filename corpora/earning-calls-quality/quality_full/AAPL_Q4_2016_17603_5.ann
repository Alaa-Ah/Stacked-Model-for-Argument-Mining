KDgZlUVPZo NON-ARG 991 1018 Toni, let me take this one.
DYffvCmhWM NON-ARG 1019 1168 I think you mentioned a number of the things that are affecting us in the December quarter, and I went through them with Katy just a few minutes ago.
QPLpe0DKdt CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1780 1924 And so when we look at all these things in its totality, we think that for the total company of course, we believe that revenue's going to grow.
VOH2r3J2-v CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1925 2110 You know that we don't get into specific product from a unit standpoint giving guidance, and so we feel very confident about the trajectory for the company and for iPhone going forward.
rVvys4ERc9 PREMISE-Fact 1169 1211 You're right, we've got an extra few days.
zV_i3hlvnk PREMISE-Fact 1212 1262 You know very well the launch timing is different.
hjeu3R-0IJ PREMISE-Statistic 1263 1347 You know that we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units a year ago.
WbDXoh9xSm PREMISE-Fact 2823 2945 In terms of owning content and creating content, we have started with focusing on some original content, as you point out.
GMgMy6dROw PREMISE-Fact 2946 3005 We've got a few things going there that we've talked about.
lsIwVidf2V CLAIM-Fact 3117 3162 and so it's is an area that we're focused on.
f7oCd0Tngp PREMISE-Fact 2734 2822 I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here.
Wf_UUP1TNi PREMISE-Fact 3006 3116 And I think it's a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view.
b-mucHjTk5 CLAIM-Fact 1632 1724 And so when you talk about other competitors, it's not particularly relevant to us right now
LZh8Cw8Saf PREMISE-Fact 1725 1779 because we are selling everything that we can produce.
tOwWNkxXrD PREMISE-Fact 1527 1631 But maybe the most important element of this is the fact that we are supply constrained on 7 and 7 Plus.
m-V6Vmj3Rc PREMISE-Fact 1348 1526 I mentioned two issues that affect us, the one-timer from a year ago that you obviously need to exclude from the compare and the FX that is the reality of our business right now.
