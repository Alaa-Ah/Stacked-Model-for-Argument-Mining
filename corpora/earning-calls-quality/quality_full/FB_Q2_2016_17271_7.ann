TB2lhIplZ5 PREMISE-Fact 593 608 People like it.
WCdkUEAtcX PREMISE-Hypothesis 609 795 The hypothesis when we rolled it out was that if we removed the latency, which is often 10 seconds to 15 seconds of opening up a web view from News Feed that more people would read news.

UKADoKK1Kg CLAIM-Opinion(view) 905 1108 And over the long-term, I think one of the big things that we need to do is see if we can not only make this good for engagement for our partners, but also a really positive business driver for them too.
