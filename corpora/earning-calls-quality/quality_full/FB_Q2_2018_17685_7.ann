WLqzuFMaWl NON-ARG 997 1007 Hey, Mark.
zNdbeqfdIY NON-ARG 1008 1018 It's Dave.
S6IlSOSZot NON-ARG 1019 1071 On Europe, yeah, we don't have any update on trends.
2ul10_aytz NON-ARG 1072 1148 We had indicated in the first quarter that we would expect to see a decline.
1fSt8bHX4j NON-ARG 1149 1220 We're not providing any guidance on MAU and DAU in Europe on this call.
IvPe2addG- PREMISE-Fact 1243 1351 In terms of number two, we have an ad model where we're able to use the targeting capabilities for Facebook.
aw6HkXZqWn NON-ARG 1352 1422 But when we put ads into a new surface, we obviously learn and evolve.
3Ipe3ZU2lA CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1423 1525 So, one example of some of the things that we're excited about, again, are the click-to-Messenger ads.
fH-djBLtqP PREMISE-Fact 1526 1672 That's something we can put in News Feed in Instagram and Messenger and it both grows the ecosystem and creates a new opportunity for interaction.
u0S7EYOHMb PREMISE-Fact 1673 1803 We also have inbox ads where we're enabling advertisers to extend their reach to people in Messenger, which is still really early.
Oe1nhEmg1J PREMISE-Fact 1804 1935 And we're also in the early days of sponsored messages, which enable businesses to reengage people once a conversation has started.
dHRq9o8jZB CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1936 2241 And so, when we think about the format of Messenger, we think about the direct correspondence between a person, either an existing or a potential client or with a business, and we think there are many times in kind of a life cycle of interacting with a business where that's a very attractive opportunity.
