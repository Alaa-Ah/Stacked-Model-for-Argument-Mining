ogIRG98FhU NON-ARG 943 1045 Sure, I'll speak to the safety and security investment, and then Dave can speak to the other question.
SR64iozW7- NON-ARG 1046 1093 So we need both technology and people for this.
dT9h71O9yo CLAIM-Fact 1094 1201 And the best articulation of this that I can make is that today, AI has different strengths than people do.
ypvY21cziI PREMISE-Fact 1202 1370 So the AI tools that we've built can enable a system to look at millions of pieces of content and make rough assessments on them and figure out what to flag for people.
oir9_9yZnj PREMISE-Fact 1371 1654 But ultimately, if you want to get those high-quality judgments today on sensitive content and you want to do it quickly when the stakes are pretty high in terms of taking down content or leaving things up, and we take that extremely seriously, you want people to be looking at that.
7tHVxQa8G8 PREMISE-Fact 1655 2120 So earlier in the year, when we were working on problems like seeing issues when people were going live, there was this really serious issue around people with self-harm and in some cases suicide on Live, and we made an investment in AI tools and in dramatically increasing the staffing of the team that was working on that and brought the amount of time to review those Live videos down through a combination of those things to – I think it's under 10 minutes now.
HBPSkCeIcK CLAIM-Fact 2121 2203 That might still be a conservative estimate, and we're continuing to work on that.
ZuRADIMjUe PREMISE-Fact 2532 2673 And you're definitely right that a lot of the AI research that we do is applicable to multiple areas, but we still need to build those tools.
TABnSya4hS PREMISE-Fact 2204 2360 So now what we're trying to do is just increase the SLAs that we have across all of these different types of content and security threats that we might see.
7cq0AoeGHK PREMISE-Fact 2361 2531 So that way, through a combination of the AI tooling that we build and having people to look at these things, we can get it right faster for more of the types of content.
kJQSLtDVIk CLAIM-Reformulated 2674 2965 So it takes a lot of engineering investment, and we will be prioritizing that, in some cases by adding people to teams and in other cases by trading off and doing more security work instead of other product work that we might have done, but this is really important and this is our priority.
LBFT_OdLRX CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2983 3270 I think on how people use our products in life stages, I would just – I would say generally, what we're trying to do is build a variety of different types of social products that can help in a variety of different use cases, so it can be one-on-one messaging with WhatsApp and Messenger.
gKQkRYomew PREMISE-Fact 3271 3315 It could be sharing to Groups with Facebook.
5Hnaa2cHHp PREMISE-Fact 3316 3366 It could be the friends that you have on Instagram
IFDPnQCp_F CLAIM-Reformulated 3368 3527 So we're trying to make sure that we flesh out the full range of sharing experiences, and we think that has applicability across all the different life stages.
bT7s-MCwby NON-ARG 3528 3639 And depending on the ages, people use the products differently, but not sharing any specific breakouts on that.
tpVLdFHWuv NON-ARG 3657 3703  Operator, we have time for one last question.
