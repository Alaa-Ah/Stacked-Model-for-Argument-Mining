yH5lGe61tW PREMISE-Fact 2248 2324 It's the highest growth rate that we've had for services during fiscal 2017.

EMZ_D-6t03 CLAIM-Reformulated 2477 2504 It's going incredibly well.

P81dH3Q2hh CLAIM-Fact 2787 2824 And so we turned the corner in Music.
9ulMzZDCR_ CLAIM-Fact 2092 2159 And it's important to call it out because of course it's a one-off.
00sZE7LDEn PREMISE-Fact 2825 2996 You remember that a few years ago, we were actually declining in Music; now with the streaming service in addition to the download business, the business is growing again.

v-pjWJOfS3 NON-ARG 779 783 Yes.
