V3e2nG6pk2 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3796 3987 And so you can see we're putting a lot of CapEx obviously there and including capital leases and we think over time we will be able to generate significant free cash flow with stronger ROICs.
U2KXowBTgd PREMISE-Fact 3673 3738 From our perspective its business that’s still really in day one.
XEiSZl4Kws PREMISE-Fact 3739 3795 A lot of potential innovation in front of us we believe.
Tr18NcQtaM NON-ARG 1191 1409 In terms of your first question, specifically related to North America, one of the – our comments we made last quarter that we disclosed was, we disclosed the growth rate globally, as well as the growth rate in the US.
nd_BE5FkgU PREMISE-Statistic 1410 1488 And the growth rate in US after 10 years is up 50%, it was 50% year-over-year.
r66ZWkrXdX PREMISE-Statistic 1489 1599 And so 2014 versus 2013 in terms of Prime membership and that’s after a price increase on Prime from 79 to 99.
0vPfZ2IuAn CLAIM-Fact 1600 1746 And so, it gives you a feel for the work that we put into Prime to make that experience great for customers and the value that we are giving them.
6W_ikeTSQk NON-ARG 1747 1775 So again, given that growth.
CD502tVLKo NON-ARG 1776 2099 And so, that’s what – that’s certainly one of the things that gives us comfort, but when we look at the individual pieces we like what we see, so in other words, some of the investments we're making, I think as we've talked about in the past, I'll give one example would be video content, both original and license content.
7NmUkwVay6 PREMISE-Statistic 2100 2352 We mentioned last call that we spent approximately $1.3 billion on content globally for Prime customers and what we've seen and to date is was certainly still an investment for us, its certainly impacting our operating results, but we like what we see.
nZxN17SwUO CLAIM-Fact 2353 2444 We see customers who come in through our free trial pipeline if you will for video content.
JAV80P9t01 CLAIM-Reformulated 2479 2653 We see – we have a great retention of Prime members, but those who scream actually, we retain those at a higher rate and we bring in new customers through our video pipeline.
AQB7080x8q CLAIM-Fact 2654 2767 The purchasing pattern that we have for those customers is very similar to those who come in from other pipeline.
Jvtoa2NIrA CLAIM-Reformulated 2768 2868 So in other words, they are buying very good from a physical product standpoint, as well as digital.
T5D9y_1Pq0 PREMISE-Fact 2869 2914 So they are buying a diverse set of products.
hQTB6K3kOT PREMISE-Fact 2915 3139 So in other words, this video content that we're spending is helping us customers who buy consumable from us, they will buy clothing from us, they will buy shoes from us, they will buy electronics, they will buy media items.
ulfaZW2Hbh CLAIM-Reformulated 3140 3222 So that’s what we're seeing and so again it’s some of these things are very early.
Qk61df15be NON-ARG 3223 3339 We'll have to over time how efficient they are, but each period we go we keep the data that we see we're encouraged.
ajZm2C1PId NON-ARG 3340 3371 And so that’s just one example.
fBMRSisQ9D CLAIM-Reformulated 3372 3606 But that’s why we're investing a lot in Prime and we think it’s a great – the Prime platform if you will, and we think it’s a great opportunity and again as I mentioned earlier all these things we're investing in are very intertwined.
VUK6DU3Gij NON-ARG 2445 2478 They convert it at a higher rate.
