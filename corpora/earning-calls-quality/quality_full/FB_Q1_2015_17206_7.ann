IRpS44mBnh PREMISE-Fact 1027 1249 For the News Feed question, the North Star for us in News Feed is that we want to produce the best experience for everyone who is using the app and loading News Feed to see what is going on in the world around them, right?
TTagLeXe0T PREMISE-Fact 1250 1457 So when it comes to – there are lots of businesses on Facebook, there are professional content producers, our main interest here is the people in the community who are using News Feed, not those guys, right?
oMDaYVVrq4 CLAIM-Fact 1458 1548 So of course we want to build tools to enable them to share their content and all of that,
baA7n-rFdx PREMISE-Fact 1549 1822 but we're constantly refining the algorithms in order to make it so the experience is the best for you when you open up your phone and look at Facebook and, there are a bunch of things that are going on, we want to make sure that we're getting what you care about the most.
e-I3o7UJEd CLAIM-Fact 1823 2059 And we go to a lot of lengths to make sure that we're getting signals from people in our community to make sure that we're doing this correctly, in addition to the different signals that we would get from seeing people use the products.
tHgQ3zD5_S PREMISE-Fact 2060 2355 We also do a lot of qualitative surveys to see what people, what makes – what people write in that they want to see from us, what people tell us is the most important thing that they saw in Facebook today or saw anywhere in the world today and what they would've wanted to have seen on Facebook.
H7ZwXVpgP3 CLAIM-Fact 2356 2459 And our goal is to just constantly refine this and make it better and we're going to keep on doing that
g_q6_V37nj PREMISE-Fact 2460 2539 because we think there's a lot of upside and there's a lot more that we can do.
IkqdONqNjG PREMISE-Fact 2540 2761 Now, at the same time, in order to make this experience good, there also needs to be good content in the system, right, so we need to make sure that people have the tools to able to share the moments that they care about.
OAQ1bILtzn CLAIM-Fact 2762 3042 But if you're a professional publisher, you need to have the ability to share a version of the content that you're producing that you're proud of, that can load quickly, that can be as rich as the tools enable people to see, and we're working on a lot of different tools for that.
-lpfFnHbCR PREMISE-Fact 3043 3434 And you can imagine that as the tools for any of this content get better, people taking photos, newspapers, writing news articles, advertisers, putting out ads for content that they want to sell, the better that content gets, the more people are excited to see it and then that informs the ranking in what the community qualitatively tells us that they want to see from us over time as well.
8XNCYhrpZN PREMISE-Fact 3435 3473 So it's just a constant cycle on that.
