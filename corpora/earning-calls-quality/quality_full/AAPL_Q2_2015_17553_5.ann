7CJ0uXdL-X CLAIM-Fact 835 898 So that was pretty much in line with what we were anticipating.
0s2BJvHvxB PREMISE-Fact 603 777 And I mentioned during the call in January that we were expecting FX to have a negative impact on a sequential basis of about 100 basis points after the effect of the hedges.
i4NbQSC_kZ PREMISE-Fact 778 834 And that is exactly what happened in our actual results.
UisXuYxHnC NON-ARG 418 515 I’m gonna give you some numbers on the currency, because I know it’s a topic that is top of mind.
ABtHRlPvlR NON-ARG 516 602 You’re asking about gross margin, and you know, we look at this on a sequential basis.
NrXHrlYRvf CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1378 1558 So we feel very good about the gross margins that we’ve generated in the March quarter, and we feel very good about the guidance that we provided, given the severity of the impact.
32hfqnbdYD CLAIM-Policy 1085 1120 We’re dealing with these headwinds.
3PoSTmkPH4 CLAIM-Reformulated 1121 1191 They’re part of business, and so we’re dealing with them in many ways.
NxJpJwZkPr PREMISE-RealExample 1192 1281 We are looking at, in some cases, at the potential to increase prices in certain markets.
6WtZo9Dqdm PREMISE-RealExample 1282 1377 We’re looking of course at our cost structure, and we try to remain as competitive as possible.
93NnRvtxIT CLAIM-Value 947 1084 And on a sequential basis, when we look into the June quarter, we expect to see another 40 basis points of negative impact from currency.
ycYNz35bsR CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2128 2170 and so we’re extremely excited about that.
jXkN7rdl-H PREMISE-Fact 2044 2127 we continue to see a higher rate of switchers than we have seen in previous cycles,
ijj4tsLWvZ PREMISE-RealExample 2171 2286 We also continue to see a reasonable percentage of first time buyers, particularly in some of the emerging markets.
_4dGHzsw7k PREMISE-Statistic 2287 2457 And if you look at emerging markets in general, I think Luca covered some of this, the revenue from emerging markets, just for the March quarter, was up 58% year on year.
RABKa-WIcV CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2509 2618 Obviously, those results would have been higher without some of the FX headwinds that Luca mentioned earlier.
IZhIIblnIA CLAIM-Fact 2458 2508 And a big piece of what is driving that is iPhone.
rFAKIVXkOf NON-ARG 898 947  Of course, we expect this headwind to continue.
