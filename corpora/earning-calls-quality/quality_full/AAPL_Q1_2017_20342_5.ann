NClEs9zZ57 NON-ARG 3111 3207 So this is one that we think different about a bunch of things, but maybe this is just one more.
53ZCbucZjr CLAIM-Fact 2525 2590 I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game.
TmdcKnYQPq CLAIM-Reformulated 2591 2623 I think there's lots more to do.
c5_La8p_Q5 PREMISE-Fact 2624 2752 I think it's become â€“ every year it becomes more important to people's lives and there are more things people are doing with it.
CCZ4CLxkyD PREMISE-RealExample 2753 2835 I talked a little bit about home automation, but I could have talked about health.
w_7HRf3Xhx PREMISE-RealExample 2836 2875 I could have talked more about CarPlay.
N8pSKhE3Zj PREMISE-Fact 2876 2933 The use of it in the enterprise is growing significantly.
7K6ojuS4jL CLAIM-Reformulated 2934 3110 And so when I look at all of these things, usage going up, app developers still innovating, we've got some exciting things in the pipeline, I feel really, really good about it.
bYis6yGPb4 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1183 1279 If I zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad.
0Qkqd27wzz CLAIM-Reformulated 1280 1345 I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product.
KSI9531Ivq PREMISE-Fact 1346 1592 When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching a penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it's not close to that kind of thing.
NzdwvuiliT PREMISE-Fact 1593 1639 The customer sat numbers are through the roof.
UBrEvCs9h4 PREMISE-Statistic 1640 1692 Literally, the customer sat for the iPad Pro is 99%.
JWBR6HfobM PREMISE-Fact 1693 1707 It's stunning.
PS1TYxsdx2 CLAIM-Reformulated 1941 2002 But again, beyond the 90-day clock, I'm very bullish on iPad.
g1Fspizx-1 PREMISE-Fact 1708 1895 And so I see a lot of good things and hope for better results, but we are still currently in this shortage issue now, and I'm not projecting to get out of that totally during the quarter.
QwGBwCW0uZ PREMISE-Fact 1896 1940 And so it will damper this quarter somewhat.
rwCOEWJOeX PREMISE-Statistic 451 539 The iPad, Steve, we had a 1.6 million-unit swing on channel inventory between the years.
ybkyfYJcyy PREMISE-Statistic 540 588 In the year-ago quarter we increased by 900,000.
Mjj-NsNt-V PREMISE-Statistic 589 629 In this quarter we decreased by 700,000.
jTgUBCI4b1 PREMISE-Fact 935 1117 In addition to all of that, we did under-call the number of iPads that would be in demand for the quarter, and that compounded a shortage issue that we had with one of our suppliers.
L9yuXZARnF CLAIM-Fact 1118 1182 And so all in all, there were quite a few things going on there.
NVANqbpXY- PREMISE-Fact 630 733 On top of that and from an ASP point of view, in the year-ago quarter we launched the iPad Pro 13 Edge.
8czi8zlA37 PREMISE-Hypothesis 734 796 That would be the iPad with obviously the highest price on it.
GqF5vpvwze PREMISE-Hypothesis 797 934 We would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the product, and so that would have bolstered the ASPs in that particular quarter.
VXPYeBXOVe NON-ARG 3261 3266  Yes.
WENDCiceBF NON-ARG 3280 3298  Thank you, Steve.
