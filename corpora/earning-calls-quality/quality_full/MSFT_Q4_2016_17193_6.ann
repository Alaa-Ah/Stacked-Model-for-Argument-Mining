10H7X8ADMk PREMISE-Fact 736 991 In terms of how we think about the absolute numbers, first I should say I think most people assume – and it is true to a certain extent – so much of this is the growth in our Commercial businesses across Azure and Dynamics and Office 365, and that's true.
iP7QRcUzI0 PREMISE-RealExample 992 1190 But we're also seeing quite good growth in some of the Consumer businesses, which also are built on our cloud infrastructure, Search, some of our gaming assets, our Xbox Live business going forward.
O0IG8Kc4tf PREMISE-Fact 1191 1343 And so many of these assets, including increased usage of our consumer properties inside our productivity business and Office, do require capital spend.

dozp14u7re NON-ARG 541 555 Thanks, Gregg.
8nTZN1XaGS NON-ARG 556 682 You're right, my comments are more pivoted toward the absolute dollar amount, which is what I tend to focus on in my comments.
VY63EvbJHY NON-ARG 683 735 So it's a good clarification, and thanks for asking.
3f1JmLwRxL CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1396 1458 And so as I think about moderation, it is the absolute dollar.
FwBj7f4Ebp CLAIM-Reformulated 1459 1579 It's not due to any change in our aspiration or belief in the growth curve of revenue, and I wanted to be clear on that.
io35aguvz8 CLAIM-Reformulated 1580 1725 It really is about continuing to benefit from scale and engineering improvements that will allow us to do that even as we see broad-based growth.
