dnBCGBMmbk NON-ARG 639 644 Yeah.
dJvqMwSXOW NON-ARG 645 719 Jim, in the opening remarks I was really talking about China specifically.
cHRZ3INNeH CLAIM-Fact 1108 1245 Clearly, what we've learned here and it's not a surprise really is that the -- many, many people do want to trade-in their current phone.
vZzSpyPesK NON-ARG 720 913 And I mentioned four things that I believe are responsible for the better year-over-year performance in the Q2 relative to Q1 and also the final weeks of March being better than the Q2 average.
mmuLnroinJ NON-ARG 914 978 And those four are the price reductions, but that's one of them.
oDq0xxzzv6 NON-ARG 979 1107 But there are three others and one of the others is the trade-in and financing programs that we instituted in our retail stores.
ZGSygJ46UJ PREMISE-Fact 1246 1379 It does -- from a customer user point of view the trade-in looks like a subsidy, and so it is a way to offset the device cost itself.
ddWpwEeGEZ PREMISE-Fact 1380 1566 And many people in literally every market that we've tried this in, there is a reasonable number of people that want to take and pay for something on installments instead of all at once.
UTx7qKbvst CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1711 1877 The other two items that are not insignificant in China that I don't want to lose here is that the stimulus programs, I believe, are having an effect on the consumer.
y8YYUGnT3u PREMISE-Statistic 1878 2022 And the one that I got much visibility in -- that happened in early April was the VAT reduction from 16% to 13%, so it's a very aggressive move.
mZcZZoCHVF PREMISE-Fact 2023 2118 But there are other stimulus programs as well that likely have an effect to the consumer level.
-_156jZvIb PREMISE-Fact 2119 2290 And then finally -- and this is not to be under weighted either -- I think the improved trade dialogue between the countries affects consumer confidence in a positive way.
6y_S2o09Z8 CLAIM-Reformulated 2291 2351 And so, I think it's sort of the sum of all of those things.
F5OO4uT81b CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2527 2678 But what really matters to us and what we look at -- when we look at the elasticity of these programs is to see the impact on our gross margin dollars.
QGTZ6XM6mI CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2679 2842 And what -- the experience that we've had in a few of these emerging markets has been positive in that respect and so that's what we think matters the most really.
lahPMgT827 NON-ARG 2366 2526 And Jim, if I may add on the gross margin level as we look at pricing actions, of course, anytime you do a pricing action it is gross margin percentage diluted.
-SFD6fR2WO NON-ARG 1567 1710 And so, it's a little different in each market in terms of what the elasticity is, but you can bet that we're learning quickly on all of those.
