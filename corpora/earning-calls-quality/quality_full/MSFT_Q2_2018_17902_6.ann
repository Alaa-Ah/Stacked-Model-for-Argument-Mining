ru0GczVTtV CLAIM-Fact 581 695 See, our overall vision for how computing evolves is that it's going to be more distributed, not less distributed.
h6i59EIwFF PREMISE-RealExample 696 754 Let's just take for example what's happening in a factory.
pM-fXWv97D PREMISE-RealExample 755 849 In a factory, one thing that is secular is that they're putting lots and lots of more sensors.
5MY4POgywg PREMISE-Fact 850 941 Lot of the sensors today are in fact rendezvousing some of that data straight to the cloud.
HQqeNcYqhB PREMISE-RealExample 942 1116 As you do more of that, what happens is you need to - and then you start doing sensor fusion, which is your multiple sensors that you want to be able to fuse and take action.
8qJJdDTZgG PREMISE-RealExample 1117 1152 The speed of light gets in the way.
HN-bhqNzGu PREMISE-RealExample 1153 1180 So they want local compute.
lyR2LD3-gp PREMISE-RealExample 1181 1311 And so, in order to have that local compute in some of these factories with millions of sensors, you may in fact need Azure Stack.
sMTQ15LWTC PREMISE-RealExample 1312 1424 So it's not just about old workloads and service providers and essentially hybrid computing as we understand it.
OQfxfshohU PREMISE-RealExample 1425 1583 When I think about hybrid computing at least in the fullness of time, it's more the future of distributed computing, where there is a cloud, there is an edge.
uDebKCTskv PREMISE-RealExample 1584 1630 And even the edge is not just one single edge.
3WEKche9Q1 PREMISE-RealExample 1631 1785 But it's got a topology associated with it, going all the way to the sensors, whether it's at home, whether it's in a hospital, whether it's in a factory.
fSrdIYmLq0 PREMISE-Fact 1786 1928 So that's where we're going to end up, which is a true distributed computing fabric that the world needs in order to be digitally transformed.
rC1UPWJBvs PREMISE-Fact 1929 2033 How - and quarter to quarter will there be volatility, shifts, changes, that's all going to be the case.
WtByRJ2Oze PREMISE-Fact 2034 2111 But we see the pattern emerge pretty clearly in terms of where we need to go.
