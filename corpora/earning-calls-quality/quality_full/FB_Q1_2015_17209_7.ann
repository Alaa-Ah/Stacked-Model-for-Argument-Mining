Rtg7VW8_iX CLAIM-Opinion(view) 672 960 So, Peter, just on the â€“ on ads engagement, that's an area that we've obviously been very focused on, and we're really pleased with the results that we're seeing there in terms of driving better engagement per ad, and that's really the focus of a lot of our quality and relevance efforts.
VxjWL5r7-z PREMISE-Fact 961 1130 How do we find those ads that are going to be more engaging, they're going to get more clicks, that they're going to get more views, that are going to get more installs.
EMA1TYVKP7 CLAIM-Reformulated 1131 1366 We're working on focusing on all of those, on optimizing the relevance of the ads for all of those different potential actions that happen downstream and we're pleased with what we're doing there and the trends that we're seeing there.
iRv1Gxeq0C PREMISE-Fact 1613 1792 We started last quarter for buy-on Facebook, and that enables people to buy products from merchants with a buy button on Pages, and it is a product that is used and aimed at SMBs.
ZfWG3PzBXW CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1793 1879 We're also very focused on helping SMBs have a presence, especially a mobile presence.
GpCd4-QMKO PREMISE-Statistic 1880 2105 35% of SMBs in the United States, which is probably ahead of most other countries, don't have a web presence at all, and an even smaller percentage of SMBs have a mobile web presence or any kind of mobile presence that works.
7gnnWZ-PoB CLAIM-Reformulated 2106 2230 And so Pages are a good and free and easy way to have a mobile presence, and that's something we're very focused on growing.
9dL7m0KrWX PREMISE-RealExample 1566 1612 On SMBs, we have a very small test in the U.S.
q2maZcp3OO CLAIM-Reformulated 1367 1545 And, again, that's a big part of what we're trying to do to drive the overall ads growth story, as well as providing a good experience for users with the ads that they're seeing.
