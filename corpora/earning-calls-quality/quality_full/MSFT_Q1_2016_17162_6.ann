SqSl-E6NGk CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1216 1342 And as we talked about, as we move through the year, I do expect things to more normalize overall in terms of RPL comparisons.
mn__nFyrIO CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1343 1440 But I do think that's probably the best way to think about the curve over the course of the year.
RokJHKzGAl CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1061 1131 I expect our overall Pro business to remain in line with business PCs.
dv1Yp8-8W6 PREMISE-Hypothesis 1132 1215 Once we work through sort of the end of XP bump, that really should be in the line.
eX9uO9bFML NON-ARG 2135 2157 And really, okay good.
l17LRX0VZh CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2557 2767 So if you think back to how we've talked about the long term, the lifetime value equation, it's those components that I really think about proving out over time, and we had lots of encouraging signs about that.
B7vfE2vyl3 PREMISE-Fact 2310 2556 We've thought about making this transition as quickly as possible, but what we're seeing, which you heard us talk about, was a transition to increasing premium mix, selling more workloads, doing all of that while we're growing the installed base.
hqgkfiOtM8 PREMISE-Fact 2913 2986 And then in terms of renewals, they're quite good, which we talked about.
WUFNPKpXWZ NON-ARG 814 829 Thanks, Walter.
udWtm2tO6_ NON-ARG 830 887 Let me talk a little bit about what I said in my outlook.
yzrwqoW5u3 NON-ARG 888 1018 This quarter, as I just talked about, the non-Pro outperformance versus the market was really due to a higher revenue per license.
mkPAglxg27 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1019 1060 I expect that actually to continue in Q2.
FJWLNo8k5t NON-ARG 1901 1984 Let me try and if I missed the question or misunderstood it, you can help me again.
AdrtP191SD NON-ARG 1985 2091 I think you're asking about our core Office commercial business, the product side versus the service side.
iij3v9Dt4A PREMISE-Statistic 2158 2234 The trend we saw there, as I said, we're 5% up in a constant currency basis.
v6DFSmleuJ PREMISE-Statistic 2235 2271 That was 70% cloud minus 8% on prem.
hJdPfg5PDd PREMISE-Fact 2272 2309 That's a trend that's not new for us.
obgAMtUpn9 PREMISE-Fact 2768 2838 New users, Satya referenced on the small business and mid-market side.
GnMhqAapFA PREMISE-Fact 2839 2912 Premium mix, we talked about how many premium services we're now selling.
_96M4bZNr0 CLAIM-Reformulated 2987 3121 And so I think all of those, when you talk about should we expect the traditional business to be in decline, I don't think that's new.
Gy-BKm97Kv CLAIM-Reformulated 3122 3237 I think what's important is our ability to switch it to the services and add more over time that really I focus on.
OeLIQkGhmd NON-ARG 3286 3293  Great.
