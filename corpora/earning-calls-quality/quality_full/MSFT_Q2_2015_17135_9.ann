XQBce2qTrK NON-ARG 1055 1113 Now the next question is what’s the uniqueness of Windows?
6Q3accgCEn CLAIM-Fact 632 875 Yeah so overall at the highest level, our strategy here is to make sure that the Microsoft Services i.e. cloud services be it Azure, Office 365, CRM Online or Enterprise Mobility suite are covering all the devices out there in the marketplace.
LwfY2sgQAb PREMISE-Fact 876 989 So that, that way we maximize the opportunity we have for each of these subscription and capacity based services.
J_VTcR3PwC CLAIM-Reformulated 990 1054 So that’s the core rational for why we are doing cross platform.
lO2qVGSVe6 PREMISE-Fact 1114 1282 And the uniqueness of Windows comes because we don’t think of these services and their application end points as apps, but fundamentally core to the Windows experience.
KoSmIdOgvH CLAIM-Fact 1283 1329 So we are building them natively into windows.
qlgVlUNIWi PREMISE-RealExample 1330 1427 So for example, when you log into Windows, you are logging in with Microsoft account or Azure ID.
bfxTvPSyls PREMISE-Fact 1428 1482 When you have files, they are synching with one drive.
0kFlsO9amg PREMISE-Fact 1483 1523 Outlook is the email client for Windows.
W-tY0BcV9d PREMISE-Fact 1524 1622 So that’s how Windows will differentiate and not to mention, our Gaming and Xbox Live experiences.

TPpoFBd61G NON-ARG 2042 2048 Great.
1tuyQ_rUb5 CLAIM-Fact 1623 1896 So overall, we will build a differentiated Windows because our application experiences for our cloud end points will be native in windows and at the same time, we will make sure that our services are available on all end points driving more usage, more subscription growth.
_AS85Y6_dR CLAIM-Reformulated 1897 2000 So the best way to measure our progress is Office 365 subscription growth, Azure growth and EMS growth.
