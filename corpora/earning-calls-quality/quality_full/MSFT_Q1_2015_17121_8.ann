3BQYI1Ydka CLAIM-Fact 797 929 And in fact, a lot of the core Azure technology around machine management and data center management comes out of our bring efforts.
CvLDR79G-I PREMISE-Fact 930 1099 We manage all of the supply chain, all of it is as one supply chain; we do SKU design as one SKU design; we drive costs of both network storage, compute down altogether.
uJ8fevmwQT CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1320 1427 In fact the first -- the fact that -- I celebrate the fact that we don’t have just one first party workload
Gd6f2-Isdt PREMISE-RealExample 1428 1538 because it’s very easy for one first party workload to completely opt if you will the architecture of a cloud.
22AyxoGjPO PREMISE-Fact 1539 1595 But in our case, we have a very diverse set of workload.
V6hG5dbLaq PREMISE-RealExample 1596 1634 We have Xbox LIVE; we have Office 365;
yQnOqHdwnI NON-ARG 672 676 Yes.
lfolIzBlKv NON-ARG 677 796 I mean it’s absolute perquisite for us to have entirety of our cloud infrastructure plant drive scale economics for us.
EKDOmODgAR NON-ARG 1100 1179 In fact you should think of Azure as the common fabric of all our applications.
aylwBoQDjH NON-ARG 1180 1263 And you look at even some of our games like Halo, a significant usage of our cloud.
RNnAnZEcCP NON-ARG 1264 1318 And that’s what’s really driving some of the economics
1CSEiwG3vN NON-ARG 1635 1831 we have Dynamics and Bing and that diversity is what allows us to build in fact for our own needs a cloud architecture that then can meet many more workloads and that’s working pretty well for us.
nMvsMXGpAz NON-ARG 1879 1897  Thanks very much.
uHTtWDHkti NON-ARG 1898 1934 We’ll take the next question please.
