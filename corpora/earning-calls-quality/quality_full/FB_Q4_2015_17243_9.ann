LndSzfRAZM NON-ARG 792 876 I think our approach to increasing monetization around the world is really the same.
br6TucXFUn NON-ARG 877 992 We need to build really compelling ad products with great formats that let marketers be creative and be convincing.
8gTgesPxGY NON-ARG 993 1058 I’ll share an example of something we did for an emerging market.
Ck_omW1tvt PREMISE-Fact 1059 1247 I’ve mentioned briefly in my remarks, Slideshow, the Slideshow product is -- enables a video like experience which phone with lower connection speeds and feature phone by series of photos.
zwVtC1m_93 PREMISE-RealExample 1248 1293 So, Coca-Cola used that in Kenya and Nigeria.
DDF20gxs-h PREMISE-Statistic 1294 1469 They took screenshots of a video ad they have produced for other markets, they uploaded them with text; and they reached 2 million people with a 10-point lift in ad awareness.
CjyfZ071o0 CLAIM-Fact 1470 1750 So, the way we need to drive sales around the world is by understanding markets, launching things like click to missed call ads in India and making sure our products work for market but also being able to connect to those advertising metrics and business metrics around the world.
129zb45_pd CLAIM-Fact 1751 1891 Video ads are important on our platform and the most important thing that’s growing well there is consumer engagement with video is growing.
o4800Hduru PREMISE-Statistic 1892 1940 We have 500 million people watching video a day.
mahBu_emI0 CLAIM-Fact 1941 2048 And the fact that so much video is being consumed on our platform gives us room for an ads business to grow
44xdBDspF4 PREMISE-Fact 2049 2086 because we want the formats to match.
CIN3rKyHK6 PREMISE-Fact 2087 2209 Marketers also really love video and it’s a really compelling way to reach people and video is contributing to our growth.
5OD_Yg2zTh CLAIM-Fact 2210 2328 It’s important to note that it’s not just large brand advertisers that are doing video but all of our market segments.
cuNlX7J-qm PREMISE-Statistic 2329 2453 Direct response, SMBs who have uploaded 1.5 million videos and have both organic and paid in the last month, and developers.
UmwgS5kfn1 CLAIM-Fact 2454 2505 The video ad spend is not all incremental of course
tSZzt2g1bV PREMISE-Fact 2506 2620 because every time we put an ad in newsfeed, if it’s a video ad, it’s taking a place of an ad with another format.
hw7PS1HFxK CLAIM-Fact 2621 2735 In terms of learnings, one of the most important learnings we have is that video formats are different on Facebook
8nC0C2eOKa PREMISE-Fact 2737 2937 There’re certainly people that are watching the whole 30-second video ad with sound, but there are some people that are doing at less, they’re watching shorter formats and they’re watching with sound.
qoDWBXBFDT NON-ARG 2938 3092 And one of the challenges we have in the market is convincing marketers and agencies and people that make the video to expand them with different formats.
ROdIUlBehJ NON-ARG 3093 3265 The good news is that we’re getting great results like the Halo 5 example I shared in my remarks that when people are willing to experiment, this is a pretty unique canvas.
sfisfwKHwo NON-ARG 3266 3367 You can do short form with sound off, you can be longer firm with sound on and everything in between.
