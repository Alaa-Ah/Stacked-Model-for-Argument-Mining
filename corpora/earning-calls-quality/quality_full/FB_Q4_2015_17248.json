We are excited about the targeting we\u2019re able to offer for our ad platform. We believe we have position that doesn\u2019t exist on any other platforms.

In terms of the story that you said, I think you have it wrong. I don\u2019t know where you got that story from, I\u2019ve never had a conversation with the team where we were behind on mobile and then I said we need to do this to make money. That\u2019s not really how we operate. What happened is we realized that mobile was growing faster than desktop and that people were shifting their usage and that it was the more important thing for people\u2019s consumer experience. And that\u2019s when we made the shift, not in our business first but in how we develop products. And I told all of our product team and when they come in reviews really just coming with mobile. If you come in and you try to show me a desktop product, then I am going to kick you out; you have to come in and show me a mobile product. And that I think was just as a crude leadership tactic, somewhat effective and helping to motivate the organization to shift its energy towards focusing on mobile. But if you remember, we actually went through a pretty tough period because we went through this period where our mobile experience was not as good as we wanted it to be and we had no ads on mobile. And we actually prioritized making the mobile experience good before putting ad there. So there was a long time where people thought that our business might not be as good because we had no ads on mobile, and that was because we always prioritized the experience for people above, even if it\u2019s going to be a painful thing for the company. So that\u2019s how I think about messaging. We know that messaging is going to be increasingly important, that\u2019s why we went out and hired David Marcus who is one of the best product leaders in the field to Messenger and why we bought WhatsApp, which the leading messaging product worldwide. And we have a formula for how we build these businesses. First, you build a great consumer experience that helps people share in a new way that\u2019s really important. Then after that you can start to introduce organic ways that people can interact with businesses, so that in Facebook is pages, the businesses that people want to interact with, the public figures, the politicians, not necessary ads but organic interactions around not necessarily just your friends and families but more public figures and businesses. And then only once you have that ramped up to a good scale, can you really start dialing up advertising having that feel good and be a good part of your experience with good content because all those public figures and businesses are already participating in the platform at scale. So, you could expect to see that playbook in Instagram, we\u2019re pretty far along in terms of having quite a mature pubic content. Ecosystem and ads are ramping well with good high quality ads because a lot of public figures and businesses are already investing in creating that kind of good content that goes in Instagram. And you\u2019re going to see the same playbook in Messenger and WhatsApp. In terms of making it so there are organic businesses and public figures, there is a bit more of that on WhatsApp already in terms of businesses using it and our Messenger, we are catching on Messenger; we\u2019ll do that on both. And once we have those ecosystems built out, we will build businesses around them.
