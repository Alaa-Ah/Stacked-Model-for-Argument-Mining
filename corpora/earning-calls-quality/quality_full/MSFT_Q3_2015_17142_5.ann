SHKyp81B4I NON-ARG 2309 2484 But quite frankly if you sort of looked at what’s broadly happening in the Cloud transition, we are participating in both the private hybrid Cloud as well as the public Cloud.
aXrdSbtLR5 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 692 790 First of all, I don’t think that of the comparison between Azure and AWS is the true north for me.
dA09tE8k6F PREMISE-Fact 791 1008 I think about the Microsoft Cloud because even the way we do capital, the way we measure utilization is all with the complete unit, which is of course all of Office 365 runs on Azure, Azure AD powers all of our Cloud,
9KhxtYz_6t CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1009 1074 so it’s really its entirety that we think of as our unique value.
QpSwhzPjDy CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1952 2108 That’s why I think of our servers as the edge of our Cloud, and as I said there’s a huge software asset in there which is becoming increasingly competitive.
FF-mbibQ3Q PREMISE-Statistic 2109 2308 Of course we don’t count that in our run rates or when we talk about our $6 billion plus run rate, that’s just pure public Cloud number and that’s fantastic to see and we want to measure it that way.
jlC1Fwx_9k PREMISE-Fact 1277 1401 So we – for example, you can in fact do a single sign-on using EMS and Azure AD in Azure and use – so your resources on AWS.
BXS1aLUMGH PREMISE-Fact 1402 1446 And then of course we have our iOS business.
tOUtlbN_o_ NON-ARG 1836 1951 But the one other thing that I – see my world view is not that all compute storage networks just goes to one place.
4mB81U5haZ NON-ARG 1480 1524 And then it’s reflected even in our margins.
ud8BZjiJkm NON-ARG 1525 1666 So when we look at our Cloud margins, they will have our revenue quality, which is very different; that’s a combination of past iOS and SaaS.
082UdiJfLx NON-ARG 1667 1835 And that’s how we want to make sure we make progress, because that’s where both product value which is unique to us and also the quality of revenue that’s unique to us.
diCFiWOY_h NON-ARG 1447 1479 So that’s how we think about it.
RbXqZl1_08 PREMISE-Fact 1075 1203 So that means we have SaaS which is a huge component between O 365 and Dynamics, PaaS which is a huge component of Azure itself.
17SYimq1kC PREMISE-Fact 1204 1276 We see many customers who would use even our PaaS services and even AWS.
