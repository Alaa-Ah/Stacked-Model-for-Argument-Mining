There\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s early, but one of the big questions around Watch that we had early on was what is going to be people\u2019s demand to go to a separate tab to have an experience that\u2019s dedicated to interacting with people around a certain type of content? If you remember the reason why we got to this strategy, it was because people wanted to watch a lot of video, but we saw that passive consumption of video was displacing social interactions and News Feed.

So, it was really important to me, and I think to making \u2013 to the long term of what our product stands for it to make sure that News Feed is always about meaningful interaction. While people wanted to consume a lot of video and we thought that there were new ways that people could interact around that, we wanted to create a separate place, where people could go to do that. And one of the big open questions was to what extent, what percent of people are going to want to go and do this? And now it was more than 100 million people doing this, I think we\u2019ve really proven as part of that hypothesis, that this is something that people are going to want to go do. That also not only with Watch, which is continuing to grow quickly, this also opens up opportunities around things \u2013 around doing this around areas like news, which I\u2019ve recently started talking about. And I don\u2019t have anything too specific to add today, we\u2019re trying to take a very consultative approach to how we develop anything around news or any of the things that touch the big social issues and certainly, supporting journalism is up there as one of the really important things that we care about. So, we want to make sure we do this in a consultative away with a lot of folks in journalism and in the industry.
