2eG2LAKtRJ NON-ARG 420 432 Thanks Brad.
eHdAwa25tA CLAIM-Fact 433 594 The way I tend to think about it is, with any service you want the gross margin itself to improve, and that includes in the Azure services components themselves.
qM1UzmNYMj PREMISE-Fact 595 731 The difference between core compute in-store versus the premium layers can be significant and we’ve had improvements across all of them.
lKn4yAJZj2 CLAIM-Reformulated 732 847 So, the real question on how and where should the Azure gross margin be is about sort of the ultimate mix of those.
PkWg83IbEy PREMISE-Fact 848 897 Anyhow, we saw significant improvement this year.
0Vzb5vYaxX PREMISE-Fact 898 976 We expect a lot of improvement again next year on each of those service lines.
FPV7-yN3k7 PREMISE-Fact 977 1368 And where the actual mix occurs among those lines, I think we will just have to wait and see, but that’s why I tend to not focus at that layer it’s like can you get every service better, can you make material improvement, and then of course can you get usage and consumption going that leads to premium service usage, and of course over time you’d expect a higher mix of premium versus core.
