ArcfFgAtMD NON-ARG 762 778 Mark, it's Dave.
kcKtJhTxFK NON-ARG 779 811 I can take those on the metrics.
xbv8lSofQW PREMISE-Statistic 812 892 From the price-volume perspective, yeah, the price per ad increased modestly 3%.
2iePU8DYOv CLAIM-Fact 893 1102 There's lots of different underlying metrics, but the overall kind of reported metric is really – continues to be driven by the mix shift away from right-hand column ads, which are lower price and lower value.
KptJ0mN7hm PREMISE-Fact 1103 1187 And then, obviously impression growth is driven by the users' time spent in ad load.
QHLh5QZi70 CLAIM-Fact 1188 1499 In terms of the opportunities for price, it's really just continuing to focus on making our ads better targeted, more relevant, improving all the different ways in which we can drive better outcomes for our advertisers and sort of meeting them with the results that they care about and delivering those results.
SCITy-yw06 PREMISE-Fact 1500 1661 We think there's – continue to be great opportunities to do that, and how the supply-demand dynamics play out will kind of impact the overall direction of price.
BMe6WEqHEe CLAIM-Fact 1662 1724 And it's going to depend obviously also on regional mixes too,
ZB_4Zo5QNL PREMISE-Fact 1725 1774 because some regions have obviously lower prices.
rti5xalxjA NON-ARG 1775 1815 I think the other question was on video.
sEnimtMpli CLAIM-Fact 1816 1881 Video is one of the big drivers of engagement growth on Facebook.
QOP0Axodsb CLAIM-Fact 1882 1968 It's also helpful on Instagram where we're also seeing the benefit of ranking changes.
A7T7P9EBPI CLAIM-Reformulated 1969 2112 So we continue to see good engagement and time spent growth across the Facebook family and on just Facebook, and video is a part of that story.
e8MQg7W7Ul NON-ARG 2113 2153 So it's an important part of that story.
