AbjOTkLPtN NON-ARG 324 339 Steve, its Tim.
vZlFkGdsBr NON-ARG 340 376 We don’t report out the precise mix.
iYSi-89bEP CLAIM-Fact 377 529 But what I can tell you is that iPhone 6 was the most popular iPhone last quarter, but I just believe to sell 74.5 million they were really all popular.
MivEeMkBrX CLAIM-Reformulated 530 547 And all did well.
zWuzLIdRd_ CLAIM-Reformulated 745 881 But both did incredibly well, and we’re really proud of them, along with the iPhone 5S and 5C as well, which continues to in the lineup.
6GUMdQrptu CLAIM-Fact 1685 1723 Obviously, that inventory was required
De2ma7Bt6q PREMISE-RealExample 1724 1866 because of all the new products that we announced on iPad with the iPad Air 2 and the iPad Mini 3 in the October timeframe during the quarter.
j7nT6P87WN CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2104 2196 We would expect it to occur more gradually over time than sort of all at once type of thing.
D-vh3eOJp4 NON-ARG 2197 2262 But we don’t guide to channel inventory specifically as you know.
Ap6-yySMxn CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1956 2103 In terms of growing channel inventory, in particular on iPhone where we’re outside of it, we wouldn’t expect to see a large step function increase.
j2zVJ0HKDZ CLAIM-Reformulated 1867 1955 At the end of the quarter, we were within the target range of channel inventory on iPad.
vP1p-1phQY PREMISE-Statistic 1498 1611 On iPad, we increased channel inventory by 1.1 million units from beginning of the quarter to end of the quarter.
HbmT5OVHkI CLAIM-Fact 1433 1497 We were not able to reach a balanced state during our fiscal Q1.
9RNPhJuR8L PREMISE-Statistic 1105 1351 From an iPhone point of view, as I think Luca covered, our channel inventory decreased from the beginning of the quarter by 200,000 units, and that left us outside of our target range on the low -- outside the low end of the range to be specific.
mc6bUhPEnH PREMISE-Fact 1352 1432 Just recently we became in supply demand balance on the 6 and 6 Plus in January.
ItQEegRjq6 PREMISE-Statistic 1612 1684 That compares to the previous year where we're increased to 2.1 million.
S1HVTBk1hy NON-ARG 548 681 There is clearly a geographic difference where some geos would skew much higher on their preference to iPhone 6 Plus than other geos.
GfIoG2hZgb NON-ARG 682 744 And so it’s something that is not consistent around the world.
