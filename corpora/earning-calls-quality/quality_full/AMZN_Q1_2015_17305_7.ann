d5WxxVJNEW NON-ARG 587 634 Yes, I think the best way to think about it is,
GZY4KgL-9K PREMISE-Fact 635 712 we certainly have an advertising part of our North American consume segments.
zAUmoH-k95 PREMISE-Fact 713 997 But the way you should think about it is, we are making some great investments for the long-term and that’s really what's reflected in the operating results that you are seeing in terms of – so it is certainly impacting the operating margins both for North American and International.
jYSUXcBdzy CLAIM-Fact 998 1271 So it’s the things that we – both Brian and I talked about that we're doing globally to support Prime platform all of those things that we mentioned, video content, original content, Prime Now, category expansion, investing on behalf of FBA, which also helps Prime devices.

_dwGLfR__H NON-ARG 1710 1848 And so we're feeding that and that’s what we have been doing and that’s what you see also and certainly results that you are seeing today.
