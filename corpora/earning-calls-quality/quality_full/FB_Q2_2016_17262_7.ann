pkptURZypd NON-ARG 890 903 Yeah, thanks.
gDnBsSRohF NON-ARG 904 917 Thanks, Doug.
huNfBywDVj NON-ARG 918 961 On the DAU and MAU front, couple of things.
ZK16WmGb4X PREMISE-Fact 962 1099 One is DAU and MAU are up sequentially and year-over-year on all regions, and with trends that are largely consistent with past quarters.
Xwp0PRF7e_ PREMISE-Fact 1100 1169 So, really good strong growth across the globe on a DAU to MAU ratio.
YHTt3WhsqS NON-ARG 1170 1235 We don't do specific break downs of those metrics by demographic.
-bqWTUzmI5 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1236 1307 We're obviously pleased with our overall level of growth in engagement.
7_qnbW3U18 CLAIM-Fact 1308 1435 On the teen front, younger users, we continue to be the best way to reach the largest global audience of teens and millennials.
O_fBD42kTs PREMISE-Fact 1436 1483 Teens remain very â€“ remain engaged on Facebook.
SbAbaVtgoX PREMISE-Fact 1484 1549 Clearly, how they've used our service has evolved over the years.
CpyueHe-My PREMISE-Fact 1550 1626 And in addition to Facebook, they're using Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp
XpeZPNNekv NON-ARG 1628 1681 So, from a teen perspective, that's some color there.
FcVPdAPbei NON-ARG 1682 1764 On the ad load front, ad load is definitely up from where we were a few years ago.
NhhMI8xKp_ NON-ARG 1765 1817 It has been an important driver of inventory growth.
Gw_XOLusnz NON-ARG 1818 1971 And really, I think one of the things that's enabled us to grow ad load has been improving the quality and the relevance of the ads, as you've mentioned.
10GkWpc0OA NON-ARG 1972 2055 And we've been be able to do that without negatively impacting the user experience.
h6PxeRmHvh CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2056 2166 We do expect that ad load will be a less significant factor driving overall growth, especially after mid-2017.
pOgIeJLAEI NON-ARG 2167 2222 The optimal ad load is really a mix of art and science.
J3O1iLAof3 PREMISE-Fact 2223 2316 We've carefully tracked the impact of ads on the user experience over the last several years.
0jDHPuEjt_ PREMISE-Fact 2317 2354 We aren't seeing a cause for concern.
K3Nw5fUzwn CLAIM-Reformulated 2580 2738 And that's really why we're talking about our expectation that as you get into mid-2017, ad load will not be a big factor in driving overall inventory growth.
uKo-8fMWrx NON-ARG 2355 2494 We also want to be thoughtful about making sure that each person's overall feed experience has the right balance of organic and ad content.
V5DjtAumcg NON-ARG 2495 2579 And that factors into how we think about ad load and where that might ultimately be.
SOsWIrHdUb NON-ARG 2739 2885 We still see the opportunity to grow inventory from the growth of people and engagement on Facebook, as well as our other services like Instagram.
rseHtdsEwP NON-ARG 2886 2936 Instagram does have a lower ad load than Facebook.
