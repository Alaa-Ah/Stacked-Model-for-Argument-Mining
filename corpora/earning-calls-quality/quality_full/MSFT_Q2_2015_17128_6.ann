cpWAmf1deY CLAIM-Fact 698 782 We have in China currently a set of geopolitical issues that we are working through.
MO8fKp8rI- PREMISE-Fact 783 825 We're very committed to China as a market.
qyGc6lWaGk NON-ARG 653 696 I'll just start by just talking about China
xLwsWeqjr_ PREMISE-Fact 826 1083 We have in fact pockets of good growth in China with our cloud doing fairly well, but at the same time we're grounded that in the fact that we need more work to do and we're working through them and then as and when they will work out, we will let you know.
-Ot2-vdBGY CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1094 1507 And I'll talk a little bit about Japan and Walter to answer your question, I don't have any concerns if that expands such that in this unique issue beyond Japan, with the Windows end of XP plus the VAT increase, I do think, as well as some of the macroeconomic environments, it tightened far faster than we had anticipated and Japan in particular because of its model for us, it is a non-annuity geography for us.
13nKwQPN9y CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1508 1791 So impacts in Japan more directly come to the P&L as opposed to on our under C&B balances and that's why this quarter, you saw some weakness in commercial licensing, but when adjusted for FX, our unearned balance and bookings actually felt quite good from our commercial perspective.
8HBX_RcbTI NON-ARG 2122 2136 Thanks Walter.
uuxtziHT3f CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2137 2505 I think with all products, I think about the complete sales cycle and I am really encouraged by the fact that we're doing a good job of moving from the initial sales through deployment, through adding on services and back to renewals and I think the importance of that customer lifecycle is really how we think about our workloads and our workload health in the cloud.
QnOAlwk8Z2 PREMISE-Fact 2506 2570 The workload that we're furthest along on is obviously exchange.
T2Ac5SyMw- PREMISE-Fact 2571 2731 It happens also come with directory implementation and so we generally think of a fast deployment also and then adding on workloads and premium workflow cycles.
qLRrJ7ZieY PREMISE-RealExample 2732 2943 And then as you might imagine, that provides an interesting environment for us to add on some of the products actually that Satya mentioned very directly in his comments such as EMS or Enterprise Mobility Suite.
f26gJx65pP CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2944 3157 So while I think there is always a lag, the actual goal is the commitment that the customers show to the movement to the cloud and then moving them quickly as we can, but also at their own pace through deployment.
