cuhvEbScuI NON-ARG 698 703 Yeah.
hpskGJdthg NON-ARG 704 783 I don't think we're sharing detailed stats on engagement by messaging platform.
aCG-oUbsMd CLAIM-Fact 784 826 They're obviously both critical platforms.
pjN4P5rNgs PREMISE-Statistic 827 870 Both have over 1.2 million monthly actives.
FHv-7kHpE_ PREMISE-Statistic 871 962 And WhatsApp has demonstrated significant engagement with crossing 1 billion daily actives.
ZSxwyOvDal NON-ARG 963 1036 So, I think that indicates the engagement that you have on that platform.
VVBuvUijTr NON-ARG 1037 1112 There are different geographies where the messaging platforms are stronger.
KFydRnJzhT NON-ARG 1113 1181 And depending on that, that shifts our priorities in different ways.
uKsPhfXFKg NON-ARG 1182 1264 But overall, from a monetization perspective, I think the strategy there is clear.
ZTjhEoIFdQ NON-ARG 1265 1324 We're focused on growing the user base, first and foremost.
XjnvSDGPOq NON-ARG 1325 1417 And then secondly, it's about building organic connections between businesses and consumers.
DKVzdqsjKX NON-ARG 1418 1501 And then third, it's about how do we build monetization around those relationships.
EprOZYYMFw NON-ARG 1502 1582 And I think there, we're further along with Messenger than we are with WhatsApp.
kKNgfHfSRd NON-ARG 1583 1653 And so, I think you see us rolling out the global beta there with ads.
aQEVPAGTKP NON-ARG 1654 1698 So, I think we'll watch and learn from that.
eBGgTJouHl NON-ARG 1699 1756 And as we learn things, we can apply them in other areas.
