kDeESj5-gI PREMISE-Statistic 641 735 First of all, it’s a 20% year-over-year growth that we’re guiding at the top end of the range.
9eDjPmTyKM CLAIM-Value 736 781 So we obviously feel good about a 20% growth.
9O2ItVmsy6 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 782 888 As we look at it on a sequential basis, there's a couple of things that I think is important to point out.
ADyUJvGjaO PREMISE-Fact 949 1021 We need to deal with them, but they obviously are a negative to revenue.
kFkzVpIhOr PREMISE-Fact 1022 1094 Those are headwinds that we had this year and were not there a year ago.
nFWmS6U9Ks NON-ARG 1095 1116 So that’s one factor.
cCCkVHjUol CLAIM-Reformulated 1247 1311 And so that’s also a factor that impacts the sequential compare.
FLHQdpEbMd PREMISE-Fact 889 932 I mentioned the foreign exchange headwinds.
-2iDCyFS5W NON-ARG 933 948 They are there.
JLwrDQMVnj PREMISE-Fact 1117 1246 We’ve also said the manufacturing ramp that we’ve had this year in the December quarter has been the fastest that we’ve ever had.
18FXKSojbi PREMISE-RealExample 1443 1574 One of them is the fact that last year in January we launched China Mobile and we had the subsequent channel sale for China Mobile.
tCGaCfV8Et PREMISE-Fact 1624 1942 And we also had a very, very strong quarter in Japan in the March quarter a year ago, which was driven by very significant carrier promotional activities, and a pull forward of sales into the March quarter in anticipation of a consumption tax increase that took place on April 1, and again that is not going to repeat.
DKIuDS0AAu CLAIM-Reformulated 1943 2055 So when you take those factors into account, I think that explains the sequential decline that we see this year.
yO-ff9avzY CLAIM-Reformulated 2056 2115 Again I want to point out to the 20% year-over-year growth.
tNlE_nLSD_ CLAIM-Reformulated 1575 1623 That of course is not going to repeat this year.
w_0OdCXxKB NON-ARG 3009 3014 Toni,
oHyqT7hVKl CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3015 3106 I am still very optimistic and bullish on iPad over the long run, as I’ve indicated before.
49Gxiufjx9 PREMISE-Fact 3107 3281 When you measure it in these 90-day clips, as we do in the short run, I don’t think you're going to see a miraculous change in the -- or an improvement in the year-over-year.
2SJw6ryMV6 CLAIM-Reformulated 3282 3361 But here is what I see when I look at it and the reason that I'm so optimistic.
h5XFbuOl-X PREMISE-Fact 3362 3414 I see that the first time buyer rates are very high.
8ouQ5BsGSL PREMISE-RealExample 3415 3598 And so by very high, I mean that if you look in some of the developed market like the U.S., Japan, the UK, you would find that 50% of the people are buying an iPad for the first time.
8hG_7oPOjh PREMISE-RealExample 3599 3635 If you look in China, it's over 70%.
0vDnQyRdZO PREMISE-Fact 3636 3736 And so that -- when you have that kind of first time buyer rates, you don’t have a saturated market.
HpoK1Nm2Ap PREMISE-Statistic 3737 3906 When I look at the customer stat on iPad, it's literally off the charts, in some cases a 100%, which is unheard of in surveys to get these kind of customer stat ratings.
fWcnVlj5Gj PREMISE-Statistic 3907 3979 When I look at the usage, the usage is six times our nearest competitor.
plAgsZe9fx PREMISE-Statistic 3980 4091 The usage is defined as measured in web browsing is like 71% of total tablets, as I think Luca covered earlier.
Nec8b8oTn6 PREMISE-Fact 4092 4151 Also the commerce taking place across the iPad is enormous.
MfVYOErHYq PREMISE-Statistic 4152 4225 Essentially over 80% of the commerce on tablets are taking place on iPad.
dRf6FCSnK3 CLAIM-Reformulated 4226 4451 And so when I back up and look at all of these, and I believe that over the long arc of time that the iPad is the great business, I also have visibility obviously of what’s in the pipeline and feel very, very good about that.
6HQ5eCTVKS NON-ARG 4582 4613 I'm thinking over the long run.
sh33g1XzoJ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4614 4727 In terms of what I think is going on, I think what you said is absolutely true, that the upgrade cycle is longer.
hSyjAT6C65 CLAIM-Reformulated 4793 4890 We haven’t been in the business long enough to say that with certainty, but that’s what we think.
J5paeXZl-l PREMISE-Fact 4891 5007 There is probably some level of cannibalization that's going on with the Mac on one side and the Phone on the other.
O9nNqz8U3e CLAIM-Opinion(view) 5008 5074 And so you probably have a little bit of that that is shaking out.
9lRHBC3Maw NON-ARG 5075 5190 How much, very hard to tell on the early going, particularly since we just shipped the new phones a few months ago.
NJLcuqO1Wa CLAIM-Opinion(view) 5191 5249 And so I think there's some things like that are going on.
4P9feWfybK PREMISE-Fact 5250 5366 On the other side I think the partnership with IBM and the work that we have going on in the Enterprise is profound.
vOYTL-eQwP CLAIM-Opinion(view) 5367 5424 I think we’re really going to change the way people work.
kKZ3BwEJ7E NON-ARG 4452 4581 That said, I'm not projecting -- to be clear with everyone, I'm not projecting something very different next quarter or the next.
BaZBaXThvQ CLAIM-Reformulated 4728 4792 It's longer than an iPhone, probably between an iPhone and a PC.
5ZfZglL7-7 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 5425 5534 I'm really excited about the apps that are coming out and how fast the partnership is getting up and running.
CSdL1d04gk CLAIM-Opinion(view) 5535 5579 And so I think that can move the dial there.
7FTqsR38RE CLAIM-Reformulated 5580 5839 And so I'm not predicting the 90-day clips and so forth, but over long arc of time I really believe that iPad is a great space, a great product and with -- also coupled with the product innovation we’ve got, I think there is a very, very bright future for it.
-6PJ24WkH7 PREMISE-Fact 1312 1442 And then there's a couple of specific events that happened last year in the March quarter which are not going to repeat this year.
