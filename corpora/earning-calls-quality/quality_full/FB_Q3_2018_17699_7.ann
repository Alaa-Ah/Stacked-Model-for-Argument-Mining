f-IrS78WDE CLAIM-Opinion(view) 576 729 So I mean across the whole family of apps, I mean all of this engagement is growing quickly and we're very happy with how we're enabling people to share.
EUkWCo58o2 PREMISE-Fact 730 869 As I said, the vast majority or the majority of the growth that we're seeing in sharing is coming from private messaging and story sharing.
qq4Uqvz9L6 CLAIM-Fact 870 902 So that's kind of the big thing.
oquefVcsdv PREMISE-Fact 1161 1240 But it was coming at the expense of people interacting with each other as much.
RBEUXryC1Y PREMISE-Fact 1241 1267 So interactions were down.
AKmAfzDknS PREMISE-Fact 1268 1344 And we got a lot of feedback from people saying that's not what they wanted.
SykLc9SOL_ PREMISE-Other 1345 1403 We don't think that that's what we're uniquely here to do.
2QXoHf3wZA PREMISE-Fact 1404 1440 It's not the mission of the company.

8OT1sR2Bgt PREMISE-Fact 903 1160 The basic story that we've seen within the Facebook app is, over the last few years, the amount of time that people were spending in the app was increasing primarily because people were consuming more public content, like passive video consumption and news.
5hiTAQUdqX NON-ARG 1734 2030 Now, at the same time that we have intentionally reduced time spent on certain things, like lower-quality viral videos, some news, some passive content, but that's what I was talking about before when I said that now the trend â€“ and you can kind of look at it in developed markets and developing.
