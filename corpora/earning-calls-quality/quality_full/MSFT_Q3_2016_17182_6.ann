_o99K7Stfu CLAIM-Reformulated 1176 1380 I'm not sure that I would say that there's any structural reason other than, the change in my worldview, other than maybe the budget and macro pressure tend to exert itself on that transactional business.
MxYZ8aFsrp PREMISE-Other 1381 1583 But overall, continuing to see the renewals we've seen, continue to see the cloud growth we've seen, I'm not sure I think of it as a fundamental trajectory change outside of that component we discussed.
ZqqHdE0ugw CLAIM-Fact 1584 1715 In terms of overall, rough orders of magnitude, the Intelligent Cloud segment has the least exposure to the transactional business.
liYp_Os7OE PREMISE-Statistic 1716 1741 It's still less than 20%.
MCsKp9owiG PREMISE-Statistic 1742 1813 But that 20%, right, lends itself in-quarter to the volatility you see.
Vag_4HSm17 PREMISE-Fact 1814 2059 The Productivity and Business Process segment has a bit more transactional exposure just because it has both the consumer and the commercial Office business, which is more attached on a transactional basis to PCs, so it's slightly higher all up.
tmTMrXu5sd PREMISE-Fact 1033 1071 We continue to see the annuity growth.
fEZSRGiVCW PREMISE-RealExample 1072 1175 We continue to see the growth through Azure and the offset to that has been the transactional business.
X-avlRjghJ CLAIM-Fact 866 1018 The first question around is there anything structural or different in that server product line, really it has been and is that transactional component.
