kKdqJw_1Nr NON-ARG 955 959 Yes.
AonKi7r3Pq NON-ARG 960 1020 This is certainly something that we're extremely focused on.
W4aVDnfUv3 NON-ARG 1021 1114 And I do think that there is going to be a lot that we need to be watching out for this year.
meC1TRql_p PREMISE-Fact 1749 1923 There are also good partnerships in place now across the industry, across law enforcement, the intelligence communities, not just in the U.S. but across other countries, too.
Owtmt5bEf8 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1924 1968 So I think the systems are much more robust.
4kkPxcGEK7 CLAIM-Fact 2473 2549 So it's -- we're going to continue seeing the adversaries get more advanced.
7d6cocuXnt CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2550 2644 And I think certainly because this got a lot of attention, it's not just Russia at this point.
ENrtLL_I6G PREMISE-RealExample 2645 2731 We've seen similar types of attempts from Iran, China and some places, others as well.
xzj2rLH6Jd CLAIM-Reformulated 2732 2778 So there's more to kind of look out for there.
M7WG0dMg6z CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2779 2831 But overall, I do feel confident about where we are.
v1_MWyvOXw CLAIM-Reformulated 3301 3415 So we're very focused on this and making sure that people know what we're doing, so that they can have confidence.
yJ_SiqWZ6q NON-ARG 3416 3473 And this is just -- this is really a top priority for us.
WkHbZ510vm CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2833 3098 One of the things that I think we need to look out for, that the intelligence community has warned us about is some of the goal of some of these nation-state actors is not necessarily to interfere directly, but to just sow doubt about the legitimacy of an election.
geCX7Ly8PS PREMISE-Fact 3099 3300 So even to the extent that we may not even see specific attacks, but if there's a big meme that there is widespread interference, that has the same effect in terms of kind of sowing doubt about things.
Q1OPqv5iRH PREMISE-RealExample 1970 2182 And you can look at the results in other elections around the world where, for example, in the EU elections last year where a lot of people were very worried that there would be this kind of foreign interference.
g_uI_KQccj NON-ARG 2183 2269 I actually had gone to the EU Parliament and testified about what we were going to do.
oj19vU1ABh PREMISE-Fact 2270 2471 And then I think the EU Parliament President after released a statement saying that we'd met our commitments and did the things that we said we were going to do, and it was a relatively clean election.
0IA7lPt8Wo CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1115 1345 Since -- in 2016, I think it's very fair to say that we were behind where we needed to be as with a lot of -- the rest of the industry and governments as well and expecting the kind of information operations that we now have seen.
rYCtR_FstV NON-ARG 1347 1499 Now the good news is that since then, it's not like this is the first presidential election that we've had to play a part in defending the integrity of.
GSSd67DTK3 NON-ARG 1500 1629 There have been major elections across the world, and each time, we're able to see the tactics of the foreign adversaries evolve.
_W7IONEUzF NON-ARG 1630 1748 Because we and others weren't really focused on that in 2016 as much, we've been able to improve at quite a fast rate.
