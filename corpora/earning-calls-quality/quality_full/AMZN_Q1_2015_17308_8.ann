C4R7_rotTd NON-ARG 1175 1220 So I can't predict for you what could happen.
V-JiRLgW_v NON-ARG 1221 1425 But what you mentioned is, and some of the periods you were describing as you mentioned what our business look like, several years ago when we Prime was nascent and we were early – a bit earlier business.
