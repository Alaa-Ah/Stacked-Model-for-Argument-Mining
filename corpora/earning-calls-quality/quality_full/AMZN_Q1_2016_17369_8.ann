rfJBkoWCCO NON-ARG 956 976 This is Phil Hardin.
Iv5pjRCSo7 NON-ARG 977 1006 I'll take the units question.
gZR_NKxmmt CLAIM-Fact 1007 1085 So really the units are driven by very similar trends to what Brian described.
4TcpM54Ejn CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1086 1225 I think when we look at the bridges for revenue, and obviously units are a key driver of revenue, things like Prime are key in that bridge.
M3xOTaSnB- PREMISE-Fact 1226 1305 I would also call out selection growth, that's been a big area of focus for us.
INbnVX24Xw CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1306 1439 And one important way we drive selection is through FBA, and so we continue to be very pleased with the progress we're making in FBA.
ZNgnMSSHEp PREMISE-Fact 1440 1600 What that means for our Prime customers is there's more for them to choose from, obviously that gives them more they can purchase, it makes Prime more valuable.
iLfohXZT43 PREMISE-Fact 1601 1638 For sellers, it means they sell more.
VrVwtR-tbJ CLAIM-Reformulated 1639 1808 And so I would say that FBA is helping drive some of the selection growth we're seeing here, so selection growth and Prime though are two very key drivers of our growth.
h3UxxxtC7a NON-ARG 1871 1996 Yeah, one other comment I didn't say earlier, I do want to point out that because of the leap year there's an extra day in Q1
AZOdQ-mG7h NON-ARG 1998 2123 Every company would have seen this obviously, but we estimated it was worth about 150 basis points to our growth rate revenue
yVoMm5eNcz NON-ARG 2125 2186 That would be consistent with North America and international
9bDCZH8yNR NON-ARG 2188 2281 Your other comment was on – or question was on AWS and a bit about margins and margin outlook
kc7clSXmrj NON-ARG 2283 2422 We're very pleased with the quarter, we came in at 23.5% operating margin on a – the new basis including stock-based compensation and other
Yjy1-yxhC9 NON-ARG 2424 2442 We're very pleased
LGsCs1UKAY NON-ARG 2444 2717 But stepping back with the 64% growth in AWS which is now a $10 billion business, but on the margin side, I would caution you that we're pleased but it is very early to start drawing too many conclusions on the long-term margins in this business, they'll be bumpy over time
Xy0VBJKhW3 NON-ARG 2719 3025 At any point in time they're going to reflect the balance of investing including global expansion that he's talked about, price reductions we may offer, and also driving cost efficiency, which for us is a very important driver in not only this business but also the North America and international segments
