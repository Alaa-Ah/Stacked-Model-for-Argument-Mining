t7EQinG9Cn CLAIM-Fact 496 604 We really have a view of distributed computing which is more expansive doing just even our HyperScale cloud.
cEa3ut3iWl CLAIM-Reformulated 605 694 We think about Azure and our servers as one distributed computing fabric thatâ€™s building.
4hATOYmjdR PREMISE-Fact 824 963 because it takes one of the bigger growth areas we have in Azure, it's IoT but it's not just people connecting sensors and collecting data.
Kma73a9fqZ PREMISE-Fact 964 1125 They collect the data, they store the data, the analyze and do predictions on it but then after you do predictions you got to do something about the predictions.
2uk_LuXYod PREMISE-Fact 1126 1245 So in many cases they choose to use especially with the new Dynamics 365 field service module automating field service.
sQ826nCVI3 PREMISE-Fact 1480 1682 This is a decision we made many, many years ago in some sense inception of Azure was built for a future which is much more distributed computing done in a very different way than the client server area.
xVhsIA1b_o CLAIM-Reformulated 1683 1843 I think we're just finally getting into the early innings of what is true hybrid computing and it's good to sort of see those in last quarter's results as well.
Gg-1GlLgFk CLAIM-Opinion(view) 695 823 We also don't think of Office 365 and Dynamics 365 as independent, we think of them altogether building out our commercial cloud
_kyflvzPvB NON-ARG 442 495 Overall, again I go back to how we think about Azure.
peFPKeEHPA CLAIM-Reformulated 1246 1479 So it's those higher level scenarios that we are seeing in addition to the core infrastructure that supports hybrid that I think is accelerating and that's something that obviously we didn't make the decision last quarter to do that.
