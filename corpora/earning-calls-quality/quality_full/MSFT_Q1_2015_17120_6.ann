iwuhRgWfKz NON-ARG 969 1169 Let me talk a little bit about the dynamics we’re seeing in particular with our infrastructure servers, as well as Azure because it is actually pretty unique, I think to at least our product offering.
yLQoeoa48S PREMISE-RealExample 1302 1502 And the used cases that we see in the cloud in many cases happen to be net new workloads, IOT was not driving our server growth traditionally, mobile backend was not driving our servers traditionally.
ksyc1ms41H PREMISE-Fact 1974 2085 And that backend in many cases in regulator industries with the GEO participation we have is needed everywhere.
CDcQS6OF-A CLAIM-Fact 1170 1301 As I said, our servers have become much more competitive because of the same technology investments that we’re making in our cloud.
wRPkVKdib_ PREMISE-Fact 1727 1973 And it turns out that the need for more computing, more storage and more infrastructure server products is much broader than just even the hyper scale public cloud because the one thing that is true is there are more devices in that unit backend.
pa5L06wrpS PREMISE-Fact 2086 2188 So one of the things that we are in fact very focused on is enabling others to build their own clouds.
qObG-Tgqd9 PREMISE-Fact 2189 2272 So, our private cloud, premium cue mix is also growing you see that in our results.
RYsQ0RcESQ PREMISE-Fact 2348 2440 We see more impact of this hybrid, private, as well as public cloud all being complementary.
8pOyZrsZVg CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2273 2347 So, at least in the intermediate timeframe, we do not see cannibalization.
U_6B3I-93I NON-ARG 3117 3157 So, but overall that’s what our goal is.
wn1j3xgg7s PREMISE-Fact 2441 2558 And of course being used together delivered more value to customers and that’s where our competitive advantage comes.
vf2tX8hWe4 PREMISE-RealExample 2559 2598 On the Windows side just to finish off.
nfMfzYpR3B PREMISE-RealExample 2599 2707 We wanted to make sure that we have competitive Windows ecosystem participation across all the price points.
bHad_Zi98h PREMISE-RealExample 1503 1598 So, a machine learning and advanced analytics of areas we did not participate even in the past.
mz9oQzb3do PREMISE-Fact 1599 1726 So, one of the things that we have seen is a lot of new used cases of Azure, which were really new Greenfield territory for us.
_2RrTPwlCQ PREMISE-Fact 2967 3025 That was really by design and so we are happy to see that.
HCboQXR7ct PREMISE-Fact 3026 3116 And so on a blended basis, of course the ASPs will be different because of the two ranges.
Cf4ryYYdAZ CLAIM-Reformulated 3158 3254 We want to be able to make sure that we compete on all price points and overall grow the volume.
ZoVJ6DMU5b PREMISE-Fact 2708 2914 So we made some deliberate changes to our business model and that is in fact playing out in the marketplace where we now have very competitive full Windows PCs less than $199 going into this holiday season.
hHzy8qSAIA PREMISE-Fact 2915 2966 And that in fact in Q1 caused the market to expand.
