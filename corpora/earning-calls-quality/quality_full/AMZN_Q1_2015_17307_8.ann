pyeRdhqdIS NON-ARG 1191 1409 In terms of your first question, specifically related to North America, one of the – our comments we made last quarter that we disclosed was, we disclosed the growth rate globally, as well as the growth rate in the US.
bfVAiOJUoE PREMISE-Statistic 1410 1488 And the growth rate in US after 10 years is up 50%, it was 50% year-over-year.
lTpuaKcXLp PREMISE-Statistic 1489 1599 And so 2014 versus 2013 in terms of Prime membership and that’s after a price increase on Prime from 79 to 99.
cCg_x8dzsp PREMISE-Statistic 2100 2203 We mentioned last call that we spent approximately $1.3 billion on content globally for Prime customers
YwuPeAVQqs CLAIM-Fact 2204 2352 and what we've seen and to date is was certainly still an investment for us, its certainly impacting our operating results, but we like what we see.
fxJUbU4eA3 NON-ARG 1600 1746 And so, it gives you a feel for the work that we put into Prime to make that experience great for customers and the value that we are giving them.
3-pE0BusJB NON-ARG 1747 1775 So again, given that growth.
IppjnpKMY1 NON-ARG 1776 1975 And so, that’s what – that’s certainly one of the things that gives us comfort, but when we look at the individual pieces we like what we see, so in other words, some of the investments we're making,
9i_ZkmkXVb NON-ARG 1976 2099 I think as we've talked about in the past, I'll give one example would be video content, both original and license content.
UsRGNPXxle PREMISE-Fact 2353 2444 We see customers who come in through our free trial pipeline if you will for video content.
1mxLlJwkRx PREMISE-Fact 2445 2478 They convert it at a higher rate.
GQgEiR0Xrv PREMISE-Fact 2654 2767 The purchasing pattern that we have for those customers is very similar to those who come in from other pipeline.
rtKgDKR3JH CLAIM-Reformulated 2768 2868 So in other words, they are buying very good from a physical product standpoint, as well as digital.
ZOm6OOmAan CLAIM-Fact 2479 2653 We see – we have a great retention of Prime members, but those who scream actually, we retain those at a higher rate and we bring in new customers through our video pipeline.
JTUHXhfuRX NON-ARG 2869 2914 So they are buying a diverse set of products.
kNjBpyANcl NON-ARG 2915 3139 So in other words, this video content that we're spending is helping us customers who buy consumable from us, they will buy clothing from us, they will buy shoes from us, they will buy electronics, they will buy media items.
sSwuzsB4xw NON-ARG 3140 3222 So that’s what we're seeing and so again it’s some of these things are very early.
MCb5imEwgP NON-ARG 3223 3339 We'll have to over time how efficient they are, but each period we go we keep the data that we see we're encouraged.
jGyxgK523M NON-ARG 3340 3371 And so that’s just one example.
FMttkagI8A NON-ARG 3372 3443 But that’s why we're investing a lot in Prime and we think it’s a great
8yrObN63LW NON-ARG 3623 3672 And Carlos, I think you had a question about AWS.
i6E4ssnX_J CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3739 3795 A lot of potential innovation in front of us we believe.
Hl5BZyU_4i PREMISE-Fact 3673 3738 From our perspective its business that’s still really in day one.
RUi0c3Po6w NON-ARG 3444 3605 – the Prime platform if you will, and we think it’s a great opportunity and again as I mentioned earlier all these things we're investing in are very intertwined
Yk_Asqa3vD NON-ARG 3796 3987 And so you can see we're putting a lot of CapEx obviously there and including capital leases and we think over time we will be able to generate significant free cash flow with stronger ROICs.
