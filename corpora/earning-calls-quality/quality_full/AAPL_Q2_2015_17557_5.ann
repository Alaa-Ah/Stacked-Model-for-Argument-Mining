CU8iFulrtp CLAIM-Opinion(view) 406 441 Yeah, it was an incredible quarter.
DwQlAwSYi7 PREMISE-Statistic 442 472 We were up 71% year over year.
zy5aC2t05a PREMISE-Fact 473 511 We set a record in China for revenues.
GZTVs3YQQb PREMISE-Statistic 773 909 And the current estimates from Kantar are that that would mean that we would gain more than 9 points of share on a year over year basis.
WBBDCfc3tB CLAIM-Opinion(view) 910 964 And so by everything I can see, we did extremely well.
TWNtM28MJj PREMISE-Fact 512 676 We did that now in a quarter that included Chinese New Year, and so we have the help of a strong holiday season, much like the U.S. has a strong season in December.
snArFCORo6 PREMISE-Statistic 965 1091 The Mac also had an unbelievable quarter in China, and I’m particularly very happy with this, that Mac unit sales were up 31%.
ajEusoxKNe PREMISE-Statistic 1092 1229 And like the rest of the world, or most of the rest of the world, IDC is projecting that PC sales in China contracted by 5% last quarter.
j5CGaBsBt2 PREMISE-Statistic 1266 1408 Also, in China, consistent with the company but at a much different rate, the App Store had a record quarter and grew over 100% year over year
wsQQr8y1sk CLAIM-Reformulated 1666 1755 And so really and truly, it’s sort of everything you look at in China was extremely good.
rJVFPVLNtP CLAIM-Fact 1410 1665 And so you can see the iPhone, the Mac, and the App Store adding, and with the iPad in PRC, not in Greater China, but in the PRC, iPad had its best quarter ever, higher than all the others, and also grew in a market that contracted for the overall market.
kLSTiR-_iT CLAIM-Policy 1756 1824 We have been working significantly on expanding our ecosystem there,
N91irElkrI PREMISE-Statistic 1886 1959 We increased the iPhone point of sales to over 40,000 during the quarter.
Q1hw21vmN9 PREMISE-Statistic 1960 1992 That’s up about 9% year on year.
NZpXQikpAP PREMISE-Fact 1825 1885 and so we added Union Pay as a payment option for customers.
GKk9AyeAGL PREMISE-Fact 1993 2084 And more importantly than the total number, we are in many more cities than we were before.
Vaecfor2-R CLAIM-Fact 2085 2129 We worked significantly on our online store.
-ud_bwU701 PREMISE-Fact 2130 2194 Our online store revenue was up over three times year over year.
RQ6Hyx52Yv PREMISE-Statistic 2279 2385 We’re now at 21 in Greater China and we’re on track still to achieve 40 stores by the middle of next year.
9jF8WTg_8_ PREMISE-Other 2386 2502 The online store will also be expanding from around 319 cities to where they can hit two day delivery to 365 cities.
hb_sIKE4n0 CLAIM-Fact 2561 2697 And so the net is we’re investing a lot across the board in our infrastructure, in our products, on partnering with different companies.
Rc4z3NZyFx PREMISE-Fact 2195 2278 As you probably heard us say before, we’ve opened several stores in China recently.
YjWgLdFDK3 PREMISE-Other 2503 2560 So adding about 50 new cities by the end of this quarter.
NpT69W6oZT CLAIM-Fact 2698 2758 The Chinese developers are coming on in significant numbers.
QaKoSXSz63 PREMISE-Statistic 2759 2880 We’ve now made payments to developers in Greater China of almost $5 billion over half of which was in the last 12 months.
v15DCAHJB7 PREMISE-Fact 2881 2973 And so you can see this enormous momentum building in the developer community there as well.
4iYPzOYsVp CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2974 3138 And so lots of positive things, and you know, as you probably heard me say before, I’ve never seen as many people coming into the middle class as they are in China.
fTK8jcunjQ CLAIM-Reformulated 3189 3274 And so we’re really proud of the results there and continue to invest in the country.
kd4rFpA1F3 NON-ARG 3139 3188 And that’s where the bulk of our sales are going.
QmizVvPzrW CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4133 4252 The IBM partnership, I think, is in its early stages in terms of bearing fruit here, but everything I see I like on it.
lzykqmxlcn CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4725 4857 And so I continue to believe, even though I’ve seen people write that, that I think that theory is not correct, and do not see that.
Ss0psuWcjc CLAIM-Opinion(view) 5133 5494 And so my belief is that as the inventory plays out, as we make some continued investments in our product pipeline, which we’re doing, that we already have planned and have had planned for some time, between that, the inventory playing out, the enterprise starting to take over, I think still I believe the iPad is an extremely good business over the long term.
yDzfdoqGA0 NON-ARG 3604 3750 Number one, we have to stop having the situations where we sell through more than we sell in, where we don’t have to have an inventory correction.
WnITeWwS3j NON-ARG 3751 3781 That was over a million units.
kirPtTPBsL NON-ARG 3782 3815 Two, have we had cannibalization?
pkiDJbVKoh NON-ARG 3816 3834 The answer is yes.
nY7hucXpr4 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3921 3988 And of course, as I’ve said before, we’ve never worried about that.
fC1Pu1uFB4 PREMISE-Other 4007 4064 That will play out, and at some point, it will stabilize.
ExnFIb6Sb9 PREMISE-Other 3989 4006 It is what it is.
2EFAJiiwu6 PREMISE-Other 4065 4132 I’m not sure precisely when, but I’m pretty confident that it will.
jkSn1Yzae2 NON-ARG 3835 3920 We’re clearly seeing cannibalization from iPhone and on the other side, from the Mac.
R3hIEsmVUv PREMISE-RealExample 4593 4638 And if you look at China, they’re almost 70%.
VnbFfO_l0i PREMISE-RealExample 4491 4592 And so things like first time buyer rates, the latest numbers from the U.S. are somewhere around 40%.
GP6vMMT94l CLAIM-Fact 4639 4724 And so these numbers are not numbers that you would get if the market were saturated.
7OUV1urvUa CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4253 4333 I’m a big believer in the ability for iPad to play in a major way in enterprise.
bofMPMlTrA PREMISE-Statistic 4968 5017 And we see customer satisfaction at or near 100%.
Y1Lyk_t_WM CLAIM-Opinion(view) 5018 5132 And so these kind of numbers, along with intent to buy numbers, everything looks fantastic, the ecommerce numbers.
BHWJGqvBcu PREMISE-Fact 4858 4967 We also see usage numbers that are off the charts, so far above competition it’s not even in the same planet.
-pI6b3JNtY CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4405 4490 If you look at the underlying data, it makes you feel a lot better than the sales do.
dG-3RyqbuO CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4334 4404 And so I’m looking forward to seeing that play out as we move forward.
OnK7AwaDtL PREMISE-Statistic 740 772 It was up over 70% year on year.
wMG0sM7jN3 PREMISE-Fact 720 739 iPhone led the way.
JNY3hYzlGS PREMISE-Fact 677 719 China’s is obviously in the March quarter.
PlToYOmfqW NON-ARG 1229 1266  And so once again bucking the tide. 
JFgceOmcLI NON-ARG 5494 5598  When precisely it begins to grow again I wouldn’t want to predict, but I strongly believe that it will.
