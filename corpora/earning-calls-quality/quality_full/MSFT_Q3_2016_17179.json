Let me go through a number of factors that really impact transactional business. First, you're right. There is clearly a macro impact, especially on the transactional business. Transactional businesses tend to be more impacted in emerging markets where we have a higher percentage of non-annuity business that's transactional business. Those have been the weakest markets in this macro environment and specifically some of the geos we called out have more exposure in this place. And so you're certainly seeing the macro impact in the intelligent cloud segment and the server weakness is there. And because frankly we saw that macro weakness, you have even seen it in terms of server shipments, right. If you look at server shipments, you'd say that's actually a macro statement. We didn't see it in any one particular workload; it's weakness across workloads, which tends to make more sense frankly with a macro or a budget IT spend constraint. And so I actually think between those two items, it's the biggest impact that we've seen in the quarter, and I expect to see it again next quarter, given I don't think the macro or IT spend environment should change in any way between these two quarters. So I think less about it being cannibalistic because so many of the scenarios in this time period, we've seen the growth we expected. We've seen it across our premium services as well as core compute. I should also say most of the weakness we saw was in the standard workloads, which I think lends itself to again some of those pressures. We also saw, and I would expect annuity shifts there, which is the final component. Our annuity numbers and renewal numbers were very good in Intelligent Cloud. And in fact, they came right where we expected in terms of unearned balances. And so for me, I do tend to think it's a bit more of the macro pressure and budget impacts than it is frankly any other statement or execution.", "start": 663, "labels": ["ANSWER"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 2632, "text": "Keith Eric Weiss", "start": 2615, "labels": ["ANALYST"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 2665, "text": ": Excellent.
