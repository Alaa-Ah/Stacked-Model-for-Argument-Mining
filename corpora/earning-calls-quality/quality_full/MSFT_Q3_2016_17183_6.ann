yDdap_nPiy NON-ARG 1190 1258 Yeah, at a very high level, Kash, let me talk about the opportunity.
5XTRPiDfKL CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1259 1505 The opportunity for us across what the cloud makes possible for our commercial business and this moment in time that I am a believer in of where companies are going to change their businesses to rely more deeply on technology than they ever have.
byZDY5ocUl CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1506 1672 I believe that our set up for that is the investments we've been making for the past couple years, as well as the investments we're going to make for the next couple.
XhzuDhFkjI NON-ARG 1673 1752 I mean that both in the capital concept, but also in my operating expense line.
BCKA0UtVt_ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2037 2163 And so for me, to your point, at a high-level, I think we can continue to drive revenue, especially annuity and cloud revenue.
Uv7XYxu8cu PREMISE-Fact 1753 2036 We've managed to do that by continuing to pivot to what I believe are these very high ROI opportunities, and pivoting away from opportunities where we've had a chance to become more efficient, and the rate of returns are not going to be as high, or the structural growth isn't there.
gjgFw-zNum PREMISE-Other 2164 2272 I think we can continue to improve gross margin percentages in the cloud across all the core cloud services.
KIYaym_dgB PREMISE-Other 2273 2432 I think that we can grow profit dollars, and I think that we can do that in the OpEx guidance I gave you for 2017, as we continue to pivot to that opportunity.
8CzdRGFgC5 PREMISE-Other 2433 2655 So I think this is one where my optimism, frankly, for the structure of the market in the segment you chose, and my optimism for our positioning within that market is reflected in that investment number that you have seen.
lEDCiwTSuJ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2656 2706 And so I would continue to expect to see us do it.
FwOfSldoAX NON-ARG 3248 3265  Thank you, Kash.
JGFmcIBzBI NON-ARG 3266 3304 We'll go to the next question, please.
