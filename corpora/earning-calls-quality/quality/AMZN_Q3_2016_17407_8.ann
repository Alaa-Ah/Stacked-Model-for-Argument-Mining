9rSe9wSS0L NON-ARG 735 739 Yes.
VHtp5D2ROt NON-ARG 740 792 The word cycle, if I mentioned that, was a omission.
Lys0R4ZxDp NON-ARG 793 812 It was a mis-speak.
uFwLSQ3NWY CLAIM-Fact 813 1002 The investment that we are seeing is a step-up versus what we have experienced in particularly the first half of this year and the last half, the second half of last year which I mentioned.
