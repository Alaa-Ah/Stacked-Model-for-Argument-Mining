KLgApeMrMI NON-ARG 475 488 Yes, Shannon.
uRkpJimYya NON-ARG 489 597 I think you've seen that Services gross margins increased on a year-over-year basis by a significant amount.
XYEzOnoGAn NON-ARG 598 678 Let me start with sequential because I think it's probably most relevant for us.
5sAxS3K33l CLAIM-Fact 924 989 As you probably know, we have a very broad portfolio of Services.
wTLJTxYdjN NON-ARG 1638 1744 But I wouldn't draw necessarily a conclusion on how this services gross margin is going to move over time.
EpItEhCUyZ NON-ARG 1745 1798 We will report of course at the end of every quarter.
OWTqfWmgCr NON-ARG 1799 1916 But important to keep in mind, it's a broad portfolio with very different gross margin profiles within the portfolio.
Qufhl7AHZ_ CLAIM-Fact 990 1110 Some of them tend to be accretive to the average gross margin for services, also because of the way we account for them.
Mw8gXUP3P6 CLAIM-Fact 2633 2691 we see huge changes in customer behavior taking place now.
xIbSwShWGW NON-ARG 3785 3862 But today I'm not really ready to extend that conversation beyond that point.
rZzyTwyuvg NON-ARG 3863 4020 We've hired some great people that I have a super amount of confidence in and they're working really hard and we'll have something to say more on that later.
cNpBBw_Cho CLAIM-Opinion(view) 724 802 It's a business that is growing nicely, so we get good support from our scale.
g3AvdnCl9Z PREMISE-Statistic 679 723 Sequentially, we increased 170 basis points.
VDXYbzlWVL PREMISE-Fact 892 923 And also, we had favorable mix.
7p-eCx723n PREMISE-Fact 803 891 Some of these services are scaling quickly and so we tend to expand gross margins there.
TcZzXejXY_ PREMISE-RealExample 1111 1240 For example, you know that on the App Store, we book revenue on a net basis and therefore the gross margins tend to be accretive.
PhGUvlN7zg PREMISE-Fact 1241 1346 But we also have services that are very successful, that are below the average for the services business.
DjoKtDooFU NON-ARG 1347 1502 And so depending on how these separate businesses do in the marketplace, we're going to be seeing some level of movement going forward on services margins.
AxQqmPmVtX CLAIM-Policy 1970 2185 And if at times we grow services that are at a level of gross margins, which is below average, as long as this is good for the customer and as long as we generate gross margin dollars we're going to be very pleased.
3l1FuwX52V NON-ARG 1917 1969 It is important for us to grow gross margin dollars.
-6LzAVdeTt NON-ARG 1503 1637 But you've seen that for the last 12 months they've gone up nicely 450 basis points and sequentially they've gone up 170 basis points.
QgdMnzcjJL CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2692 2829 And we think that it will accelerate as the year goes by to sort of the breakdown of the cable bundle that's been talked about for years.
-SH02btTCZ NON-ARG 2904 2967 And so we're going to participate in that in a variety of ways.
Bk8H8BSxvH CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2830 2903 And I think that it'll likely take place at a much faster pace this year.
LlrNo_3mnY PREMISE-RealExample 2968 3044 One of those is through Apple TV and you're well familiar with that product.
K3E-EXv2gc PREMISE-RealExample 3045 3165 The second way is AirPlay 2, which we have as just pointed out we have support on a number of different third-party TVs.
Uz7fwDs3WD PREMISE-Fact 3196 3282 It makes the experience in the living room with people using our products even better.
hL58X4_-7M CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3283 3334 We think that people are really going to like that.
4vguLEI9d3 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3461 3641 And I would guess that that's going to accelerate into the future as the bundle breaks down and people begin to buy likely multiple services in place of their current cable bundle.
uqeUvCSbmb PREMISE-Fact 3734 3784 We have signed a multiyear partnership with Oprah.
k_tr16nFR3 NON-ARG 3166 3195 And we're excited about that.
sHJOqUDKpV NON-ARG 2617 2633  Yeah, Shannon, 
qjWcMRJiPX NON-ARG 3334 3424  Another way is, of course, all the third-party video subscriptions that are on the store.
HcleMiKfTf NON-ARG 3425 3460 We are participating in this today.
JBxTebymVZ NON-ARG 3641 3734  And then finally, original content where we will participate in the original content world. 
bEpAAfNkTb NON-ARG 4034 4054  Thank you, Shannon.
MfXobsCTGi NON-ARG 4055 4095 Could we have the next question, please?
