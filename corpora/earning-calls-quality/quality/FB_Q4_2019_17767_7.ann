IzZ7ZfkUwU NON-ARG 2110 2115 Sure.
VItyE0xaEW CLAIM-Fact 2116 2191 And on payments, we're focused in different places with different products.
3zV2LS1jbS CLAIM-Fact 2192 2302 For things like Instagram and even a lot of what we're doing on Facebook, it's a lot more developed countries.
QTNHmuGEJw CLAIM-Fact 2303 2356 For WhatsApp, it's the biggest countries on WhatsApp.
PdtKMaNbwZ PREMISE-RealExample 2357 2486 So that's countries like India and Mexico and Brazil and Indonesia, which will make up a large part of the community on WhatsApp.
9zITHqVDJG CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2697 2928 From a small business perspective, being able to close the loop on ads and transactions, we think, is just going to make it so that it's more valuable to have a presence on our services, and buying ads is going to be more valuable.
rt6xE-EkpE PREMISE-Fact 2929 3077 So click-to-messaging ads, which the ads run in Facebook and Instagram but then link you to WhatsApp or Messenger, is a product that's growing well.
RvpvpUCBje PREMISE-Fact 3078 3321 As you can complete more payments in WhatsApp and Messenger, you would expect it to be worth more for businesses to bid more there, which is why we're so far focused on making it so that the payments can be free or really as cheap as possible.
qgXkgogVg_ CLAIM-Reformulated 3322 3513 Because we think that from a business perspective, we will get some of the value just by having the services be more valuable for businesses and the ad prices that they'll bid in the auction.
XggkzUNUFR NON-ARG 2488 2696 The way that we expect that this will work out is basically for people, it's just -- this is an important feature to be able to move your money around, pay friends and individuals as well as small businesses.
QqfUNZX89D NON-ARG 911 925 Sure, Michael.
01ccKxvjmL NON-ARG 926 950 I'll take the first one.
p2Dx0MAHY4 NON-ARG 951 1027 So this has been a pretty consistent question that's come up over the years.
ESrhmvsPtB CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1028 1241 And I think the answer largely is the same as I've given on previous calls, which is the U.S. and Canada segment is really a pure-play developed market, which is U.S. and Canada is the 2 countries in that segment.
A8DpsGSQBL CLAIM-Fact 1242 1279 Europe is a broader mix of countries.
CInqxtMtXx PREMISE-RealExample 1280 1341 So you've got Eastern Europe, and you've got Turkey in there.
l9khQmHgj_ NON-ARG 1342 1432 So you've got just lower ad market per capita countries that are included in that segment.
NoPOgwOLag NON-ARG 1433 1512 It's a much closer number if you were to look just pure-play at Western Europe.
Yi3ySBuF6E CLAIM-Fact 1513 1632 And then there's obviously different engagement levels, maturity of Instagram in those markets that also plays into it.
eEm_5t5tJy PREMISE-Fact 1633 1775 I guess not for the Facebook-only stats, but I think you just get different dynamics based on the, really, characteristics of those countries.
N-Re6_MGLE PREMISE-Fact 1777 1945 So that's really what's driven the difference in ARPUs, and you're also getting faster growth in general in the lower-ARPU countries both within Europe and within APAC.
qUcCV3aS-i CLAIM-Fact 1946 2092 So that tends to also have a mitigating impact on ARPU because of the mix towards those lower-ARPU countries as the users grow there more quickly.
