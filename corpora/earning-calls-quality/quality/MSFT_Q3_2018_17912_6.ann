J6-qSIa_ZA NON-ARG 1272 1404 Yeah, I mean, I think when we talk to customers and CDOs, CEOs, what have you, we talk about four digital transformational outcomes.
3cUG4-PNA2 CLAIM-Fact 1405 1601 In fact, everything that we do across our solution areas are all ingredients to helping our customers achieve digital transformation objectives on, for example, how do they engage their customers.
qjaV1UxLUn PREMISE-RealExample 1602 1804 When I talked about Cosmos DB growth, Cosmos DB happens to be one of the best database products to be able to capture the signals that you want around your customers from a variety of different sources.
9c7FkGMutQ PREMISE-RealExample 1805 1835 That's gone one example of it.
49KiEoBi5H PREMISE-Fact 1836 1899 The second piece is of course around empowering your employees.
PFYACHJkFN PREMISE-Fact 1900 2145 I mean, one of the things that now has increasingly become a number one priority for every CEO is to make sure that the right tools, the right products are in front of their own employees so that they can do their very best work and collaborate.
ZNPnzdUqWw PREMISE-Fact 2146 2160 So teams grow.
psCR8HIroF PREMISE-RealExample 2161 2265 There's a great example of how companies are modernizing their workforce with things like Microsoft 365.
Syl-oLUkJi PREMISE-RealExample 2266 2306 The third one is operational efficiency.
v0BSyKtWhM PREMISE-Fact 2307 2553 When you see the Dynamics 365 growth or Azure IoT growth, taking every IoT project, it ends up as a field service project, so that's a classic way somebody says, let me sense something, predict something and then actually fix using field service.
W15toTgN88 PREMISE-Fact 2554 2624 So that's a transformational outcome where we're very well positioned.
WDYtZDcUbL PREMISE-Fact 2625 2679 And lastly, people are changing their business models.
FVc86Xh7q0 PREMISE-Fact 2680 2717 You take somebody like a Nalco Water.
2qeg9zU3By PREMISE-Fact 2718 2800 You could say they're a water company, but now they're pure water service company.
wZmrjLf4s- PREMISE-Fact 2801 2926 In other words, they put sensors that allow them to actually deliver a very differentiated business model to their customers.
9ukoC96cnx CLAIM-Reformulated 2927 2978 And so that's the transformational outcomes we see.
hrtYyY7W5F CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2979 3188 And we feel, at Microsoft, we're well positioned both with the technology but also with our frontline sales capability, service capability and partner capacity to best address the digital transformation needs.
