_DduJosZj1 PREMISE-Statistic 678 708 We are guiding to $62 billion.
-1J5HMRk_b CLAIM-Value 709 755 It's a strong double-digit growth, 13% to 17%.
e7OC4ItJ3r PREMISE-Statistic 756 814 In context, it's $7 billion to $9 billion above last year.
rfB91Q8mum PREMISE-Statistic 815 1075 So when you put things in perspective and you add the $10 billion of growth that we had in the first quarter and the $7 billion to $9 billion that we're guiding to for the second quarter, you're talking about $17 billion to $19 billion of growth in six months.
y3h_4l6rIh NON-ARG 1076 1103 This is at the macro level.
w0mmo7ctEx NON-ARG 1104 1220 We typically don't go into this level of detail, but think it's important this quarter to give you additional color.
ceHH6NvSV7 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1221 1373 And maybe the two most important messages are that we believe iPhone revenue will grow double digits as compared to last year, during the March quarter.
5_sM-N3rpY CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1374 1548 And also and importantly that iPhone sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis will be actually accelerating during the March quarter as compared to the December quarter.
Jkkk50Wgg1 NON-ARG 1549 1686 Let me explain the factors that we took into consideration as we came up with our iPhone units and ASP that are embedded in our guidance.
1tdQTS896T NON-ARG 2472 2536 For ASPs, there's also another element that we need to consider.
wTwhuZ1aYd PREMISE-Fact 2537 2624 As you know, our newest products this year have a higher ASP than they had in the past.
dnjt9kwT_G CLAIM-Reformulated 2828 2976 So in summary, our guidance for iPhone; we got double digit year-over-year growth and acceleration of sell-through growth on a year-over-year basis.
XAXHICzqOb CLAIM-Reformulated 2977 3194 For the balance of the Company, in the aggregate, we expect to grow strong double-digits year-over-year and particularly very strong performance in service and in wearables like we’ve seen during the December quarter.
pmXtY4SBHI NON-ARG 3195 3213 I hope this helps.
9ht5AuIhuf CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2625 2827 And so as a result, as we reduce inventories of these newest products, the overall ASPs for iPhone in Q2 will naturally decline sequentially by a higher percentage than we have experienced historically.
joxKsHsHiS PREMISE-Fact 1687 1835 Historically, because the channel fill and the holiday season, our selling volume during the December quarter is generally higher than sell-through.
S5kbqTXFB5 PREMISE-Fact 1836 1959 This year, the difference was further magnified, because we shipped iPhone X in November rather than the September quarter.
SY5LTJnLob PREMISE-Fact 1960 1998 We had a very successful product ramp.
TFh6FROu4C CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1999 2178 We were able to reach supply/demand balance in December, which placed the entirety of our channel fill for iPhone X in Q1 and this will have an effect on both units and ASP in Q2.
B6k2gke_QT NON-ARG 2179 2231 Now, for units, there is a second point to consider.
oD90sM633k CLAIM-Fact 2232 2300 We typically reduced channel inventory for our newest iPhones in Q2,
8PfMEBBVpu PREMISE-Fact 2301 2418 because they enjoy very large demand in the initial weeks of sales, which are compounded by the holiday season in Q1.
frTw6yViiX CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2419 2471 So we anticipate doing that in Q2 this year as well.
tLBIMVhGjd NON-ARG 3617 3662 Let me walk you through the sequential first.
dkL0l788ug CLAIM-Fact 3663 3737 So we’re guiding about flat sequentially in spite of the loss of leverage.
lpCyvupvn7 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3836 3919 And we expect to offset the seasonality impact with cost improvements and with mix.
20qo0-30xN CLAIM-Policy 3738 3835 That is the largest element that we need to take into account because of our typical seasonality.
xewIemIrzl CLAIM-Fact 3920 3961 FX on a sequential basis is fairly muted,
x8TCwA6Psg PREMISE-Fact 3962 4080 because as you know, we've got a hedging program that protects us from the volatility of currencies in the short term.
C6LwjBM-t3 CLAIM-Fact 4081 4255 Certainly, weaker dollar in the long term, if it holds, will be a positive but it's not something that you're going to be seeing translating to gross margin tailwind quickly.
qqaeasQbCW NON-ARG 4256 4300 And so I think we need to keep that in mind.
m_aQ5l_zlt CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4301 4495 We also need to keep in mind that we continue to experience a difficult memory pricing environment, which we think is going to start improving as we move into the second half of our fiscal year.
JEvP4zfSD5 PREMISE-Fact 4496 4552 But it still has a negative impact in the March quarter.
