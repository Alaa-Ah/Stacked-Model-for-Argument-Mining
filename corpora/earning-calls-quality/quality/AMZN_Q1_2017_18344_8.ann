utF69eR4Mk NON-ARG 896 901 Sure.
7CswyCaKEZ NON-ARG 902 932 Let me start with advertising.
i8IF-eTHru CLAIM-Opinion(view) 933 967 So, yes, I think scale is helping.
dENQga0MS2 PREMISE-Fact 968 1029 We've had great teams working on advertising for a while now.
BfpUaDU-VV PREMISE-Fact 1030 1228 Our scale and number of customers, number of clicks, number of eyeballs, and new content – video content and other opportunities for advertising has really helped create some scale in that business.
7MAKos4_Ex CLAIM-Reformulated 1229 1249 So we're very happy.
HGnoODyRUB NON-ARG 1250 1277 I can't project it forward.
ClZbC7YqUJ NON-ARG 1454 1542 On your second point about fulfillment capacity; here's how I'd generally generalize it.
2ffDMVNgOU PREMISE-Fact 1543 1709 In Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal or pretty transparent anyway that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong demand for FBA space and services.
TrWd2Nlu3d PREMISE-Fact 1710 1854 Last year we changed some of our incentives and worked with FBA merchants to try and have better throughput through our FCs, particularly in Q4.
PGbfjhYVNA PREMISE-Fact 1855 1978 That combined with the step-up in fulfillment centers that I mentioned, the 26 new ones, left us in a really good position.
RxJiGYYltb PREMISE-Fact 1979 2102 We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers – for FBA sellers.
w2FfmNhikx PREMISE-Fact 2103 2344 So that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime eligible ASNs that FBA provides.
m0Vnx2yOmU PREMISE-Fact 2345 2425 So, again, they're self-reinforcing, the FBA program and also our Prime program.
lU7AiW2RBJ PREMISE-Fact 2426 2690 The Prime program attracts more people to Amazon, and they buy more including FBA products and conversely more FBA products in our warehouses helps our in-stock of things that people want to buy, Prime eligible in-stock, and that helps reinforce the Prime program.
SC0XT1WgG7 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1317 1453 I think the sponsor products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth.
m_uG6aQ3Rr CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1278 1316 But we're happy with the growth there.
