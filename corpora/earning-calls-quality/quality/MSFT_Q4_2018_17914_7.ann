Dk5Ks_6UKB NON-ARG 568 581 Thanks, Karl.
kdFzWlRz02 NON-ARG 582 691 Let me break up that question a little bit, because you actually asked a couple of things that are important.
aS1ZrUBsjC CLAIM-Fact 692 841 Number one, the unearned strength that we saw at the end of Q4, you’re right, was very good execution on renewals on a reasonably large renewal base.
4EAAa81uTd CLAIM-Fact 842 1004 But, there was also very good execution of adding new workloads, adding new opportunity in Q4, things such as Azure, as an example or Dynamics 365, as an example.
x0Zj9bofQC CLAIM-Reformulated 1005 1089 So, really Q4 wasn’t just renewal activity, it was also new workloads and new value.
WbnFxHIUGF CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1090 1242 So, when you look into ‘19, I am optimistic on both of those fronts, good execution continuing on renewals as well as adding new value, new opportunity.
RCI-iHr5Lm NON-ARG 1243 1334 And the third component of the question was really how did the renewal base correlate FY18?
ykj0hWvGXw CLAIM-Fact 1335 1508 And the answer is, it’s a little bigger, but it actually has the same amount of volatility quarter-to-quarter, so Q1 renewal base is actually almost equivalent to last year.
