L1nl0__upk NON-ARG 978 994 Thanks, Heather.
FEhP7scHuZ CLAIM-Fact 995 1138 In general, fiscal 2019 will have a higher base than fiscal 2018, just as you start to think through the impacts on bookings for the next year.
fH4v_hIQnO PREMISE-Fact 1139 1229 And as we talked about, Q3 has that same attribute, it's higher than it was a year-ago Q2.
KmK8FFKpLw PREMISE-Fact 1230 1301 The reason we called it out, obviously, because it was such an outlier.
kp9h6hFPna PREMISE-Fact 1302 1448 And if you look back three years sort of how this EA expiry base works, our performance this quarter was really strong compared to three years ago
ib6FqCpP3B CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1450 1554 So I feel great about our sales execution especially in terms of growing the recapture rate at accounts.
3L_ienZPlP CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1555 1806 To the question on the demand signals we're seeing in the U.S. in particular - I think, it is quite early, but as we said the U.S. has been a good market for us and a strong market for us for a good period of time, and it was again in Q2, as we noted.
dSZMvpsYSS CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1807 1952 And I think, we are optimistic as we look to H2, when we see the signals we're seeing in the market whether it's PCs, server or the cloud demand.
