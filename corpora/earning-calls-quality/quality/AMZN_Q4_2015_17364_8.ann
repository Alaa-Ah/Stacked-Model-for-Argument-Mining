JbAzMNY5aV NON-ARG 610 615 Sure.
KVNy7Pn0Qa CLAIM-Fact 616 771 First, on guidance, we keep it pretty consistent process on how we look at guidance and how we value or how we estimate the near-term view of the business.
ynPSPrR69M PREMISE-Fact 772 879 I will point out that Q4 is obviously a very large quarter, the largest revenue quarter by far of the year.
Zm6CN_BdaV PREMISE-Fact 880 957 There's a lot of demand that comes in the last six weeks of the year as well.
RtkDLCxeNv PREMISE-Fact 958 1032 So very, very little visibility at the time of guidance when we do recall.
