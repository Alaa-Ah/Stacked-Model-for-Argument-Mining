iMYbIGkorE NON-ARG 515 520 Sure.
gnVl_c9_16 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 521 647 As far as Q2 is concerned, we were very encouraged by the revenue and unit growth acceleration, particularly in North America.
ynvAwSq3aR PREMISE-Statistic 740 844 Also point out that AWS stepped up its run rate from a $14 billion run rate last quarter to $16 billion.
4Nu9nci3rR PREMISE-Fact 845 952 So we saw the largest quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increase in revenue in that business as well.
MwNfPcxbPH PREMISE-Statistic 953 996 And gross margin expanded 130 basis points.
mFaOZ5A86y CLAIM-Fact 997 1410 So as you point out, the year-over-year difference is primarily driven by investments, what we were within the guidance range and we continue to invest in, as I said, fulfillment capacity and logistics services, digital video, our Echo and Alexa, Echo devices and Alexa platform India, the buildup at the AWS infrastructure, all the things I mentioned not to mention Prime Now and Amazon Fresh and Prime benefits.
ZGF4otFzsa PREMISE-Fact 1411 1465 We did see a big jump in head count in year-over-year.
Qye2zuMOr4 PREMISE-Statistic 1466 1556 You'll see it's 42%, and in the past, I'd say most of that is driven by operations hiring.
gzXKYMk7-8 CLAIM-Reformulated 1813 1908 So, yes, the growth rate of those two job categories actually exceeded the company growth rate.
txDKOsQ48D CLAIM-Reformulated 1909 2044 So we are adding â€“ having success hiring a lot of people and pointing them at some very important programs and customer-facing efforts.
n_KJgfmKt7 NON-ARG 2045 2164 On the place of physical, again, as I mentioned in the earlier question, we are experimenting with a number of formats.
5bhPauvelG NON-ARG 2165 2409 You've seen the physical bookstores and I would say that the benefit there is again, we have a curated selection of titles and it's also a great opportunity for people to touch and feel our devices and see them, especially the new Echo devices.
W-BwaZz2hS NON-ARG 2410 2584 I went into the store in Seattle last week and I saw about a third of the people were standing around the device table learning how they work, how they interact with devices.
Ts1P6gpCPv NON-ARG 2585 2710 So, I saw firsthand the customer experience, I think, that's what we're seeing as a benefit to the physical stores right now.
Aox1W4trNQ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 648 739 We see that tied to the Prime growth and the adoption of Prime and success of that program.
hXjgXhlSQ6 PREMISE-Fact 1557 1668 I've even said that headquarters or office hiring many times in the past was below the level of revenue growth.
3wqGcV-HPs PREMISE-Fact 1669 1812 Right now, what we're seeing is an accelerated growth rate in software engineers and also sales teams to support primarily AWS and advertising.
