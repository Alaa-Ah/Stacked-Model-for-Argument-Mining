oqcQ0JETVF CLAIM-Fact 1017 1091 We have a very, very good compelling platform across our commercial cloud.

DCSyPGTCg1 CLAIM-Fact 1190 1298 It's clear that we also have a fantastic alignment of our business model with the interest of our customers.
0cQXdJgE5P CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1991 2064 That's definitely something that I'm sure our customers pay attention to.
c9zhaDAcYu CLAIM-Fact 2065 2291 But we are very focused on making sure that we have the right product that's competitive in the marketplace and then our business model that's long-term aligned with the interest of our customers, and we'll stay focused on it.

8C-XLDkSdL PREMISE-Other 1299 1720 In other words, we want to make sure that we are, in fact, making our customers fully capable digital companies in their own right, whether they're in retail, whether they're in oil and gas, whether they're in health care because that's really what's in our long-term interest, which is to ensure that they have full digital capability, and then they'd use the subscriptions and the consumption capabilities of our cloud.
KtbYGeWwb5 PREMISE-Other 1721 1990 And of course, that means we have a trusted relationship, which is a competitive advantage in a world where some of our competitors have more complex business models, where in some cases they give them platforms, in other cases where they compete with them or tax them.
