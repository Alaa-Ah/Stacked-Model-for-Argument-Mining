ExSsIZI301 NON-ARG 540 564 Let me start with India.
2qtadEq02U CLAIM-Fact 769 930 We've invested a lot in our global selling program, which helps Indian sellers not only reach customers in India, but also in other geographies around the world.
wu1UR-lTX1 PREMISE-RealExample 931 1109 We started Amazon Flex in India, which helps our local partners to deliver packages, gives them jobs, grows our delivery capacity for sellers and increases our speed of delivery.
IL6YR1cjdf PREMISE-Fact 1129 1196 We've also introduced package-free shipment program in nine cities.
bqgS4myxKT PREMISE-Fact 1197 1311 This is going to be a big part of our shipment zero program, a vision to make all Amazon shipment net carbon zero.

GevUtXNR6i CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1606 1736 So, we think there's a lot of shared purpose there and a good quarter where we're looking forward to the Diwali holiday this year.
CTWf_EoDLj PREMISE-Fact 1737 1860 The events we have for Diwali were all in Q4 last year some of them are in Q3 this year based on the timing of the holiday.
XJW4m1r-Ct CLAIM-Fact 1861 1958 So, that's factored into our international â€“ excuse me, our, revenue growth rate for the quarter.

SY5QgeAvsp NON-ARG 1984 1997 This is Dave.
ubNJTGqait CLAIM-Fact 1998 2078 Just quickly on the Alexa point and auto, Alexa is really a more and more place.
d2cENnMLgn NON-ARG 2079 2198 I think the point you're probably referencing is, we're now seeing hundreds of third-party devices with Alexa built in.
N71d5eoAAR PREMISE-Fact 2199 2305 So that runs the gamut from smart thermostat and another smart home devices, headphones, but also vehicle.
