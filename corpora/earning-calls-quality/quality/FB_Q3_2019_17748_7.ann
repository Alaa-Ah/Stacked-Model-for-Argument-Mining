IWsxt2uOWI PREMISE-Fact 1483 1842 We face a very wide range of issues here from really hard technological problems to issues scaling large organizations to of course a lot of now major regulatory and social issues and having different people or different perspectives can help us navigate that and provide both advice and oversight to make sure that we're doing a good job is really important.
BUnRR5-Yfv CLAIM-Fact 1430 1482 It's been an incredible benefit running the Company.
0PJxVYXMiX PREMISE-Fact 1320 1429 Yes, on Board members, there are a lot of great leaders who serve on our Board, who have served on our Board.
99DMilqTTc CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1843 2065 And I just want to add one more time, Sue really did an amazing job on our Board and I'm sad to see her go and she has really helped shape a lot of what we do and I'm just incredibly grateful, perfect to mentioned it here.

_f06qjtYdR NON-ARG 972 1015 So I think that's also showing good growth.
VCmdkzxinH CLAIM-Reformulated 1016 1190 So I'd say overall not a big change in the gap there and overall the impression growth is really the story for Stories and will remain the story we think for the near future.
