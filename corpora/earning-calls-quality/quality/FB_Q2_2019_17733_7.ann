95DYmLmtJx PREMISE-Fact 830 994 We are seeing faster growth in impressions coming from Stories and then also coming from geographies that monetize at lower rates on things like Facebook News Feed.
9bYOLYWjnD PREMISE-Fact 995 1115 So even though we’re seeing good impression growth that’s impression growth it’s flowing through at a lower price point.
