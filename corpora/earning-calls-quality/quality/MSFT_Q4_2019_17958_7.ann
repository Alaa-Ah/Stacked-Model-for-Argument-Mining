OWUcGsRuLi NON-ARG 710 761 I will just take the second one then you can go on.
JG9MJg1OjQ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 762 807 I mean I think it is a very significant deal.
hqjiBN4ydS PREMISE-Fact 808 985 I’m not going to comment on any specific dollar terms, it is the largest commercial deal that we’ve signed of the size and we see -- we’ve line of sight to many more such deals.
y5UaExKIO4 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 996 1185 When we think about bookings growth, I'm not sure -- for me -- break it down into two pieces, which is I think about bookings which were very good this quarter, has two fundamental motions.
ycjYSZpp0i CLAIM-Fact 1186 1251 There's a motion around renewals and there's a motion around new.
MlKd0e7H33 CLAIM-Fact 1252 1439 Both were very good this quarter and it wasn't while certainly long-term Azure contracts had a meaningful component of the new, they weren't alone and being the only component of the new.
utbdl7hkSU CLAIM-Fact 1440 1804 And renewals, as I mentioned earlier, we saw very good execution, not just on renewals in quarter, but really healthy behavior in terms of maybe expirations that we’ve seen happen earlier in the year getting renewed, because of the new value prop and the commitment of the sales team to make sure that we landed a really thoughtful high customer value transaction.
bDRZKTC2Sm CLAIM-Fact 1805 2066 So, while these long-term large contracts will add volatility to that number, if you look at our -- see in our balance of $91 billion and see that that also grew 25% year-over-year, you will get a sense that it certainly wasn't alone in its impact for the year.
