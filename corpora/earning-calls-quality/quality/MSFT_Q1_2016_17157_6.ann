CKqC32MqMU PREMISE-RealExample 1349 1584 The mix even, that information protection, I mean that's just another very important point which is amongst the customers who are using Office 365, already 20 million are using some of these premium services like information protection
Zc-RQOL2qb PREMISE-Fact 1586 1712 And of course we're going to further expand that with new SKUs and new categories that are going to become part of Office 365.
