0xR31BqLm4 CLAIM-Fact 1092 1143 We saw about a 200 basis point change this quarter.
xX_BRNiuXl PREMISE-Fact 1144 1284 It's entirely due to the shift to the cloud, both in our Productivity and Business Process segment as well as the Intelligent Cloud segment.
0QEcLJeVWt CLAIM-Fact 1644 1704 And you're right in that our strong operating expense focus,
ALy_CiGWmm PREMISE-Statistic 1705 1937 because really, this is the quarter when you've been able to see actually in Q2 and Q3 now us really pivoting that investment in OpEx to our Intelligent Cloud and the opportunity we see there across engineering, sales and marketing.
xeH36_zI1C CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1938 2061 And you're right, we do expect to see and continue to do that as we lead into 2017 within the overall envelope I discussed.

XipLvXBgat NON-ARG 981 1011 Karl, thanks for the question.
PfUK8B3XFP NON-ARG 1012 1029 And you're right.
isZkLozbjv NON-ARG 1030 1077 In general, let me spend a few seconds on that.
e1A6W4ZHIN NON-ARG 1078 1091 You're right.
ro1HdLQtNd CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1285 1456 Those were the exact same drivers in the gross margin change that we guided to in Q4, and I would expect stability as we've seen it in our More Personal Computing segment.
JvPRsNbg4Y CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1457 1642 And so as you think about 2017, with the continued acceleration of our cloud mix and actually continued momentum in annuity, I would expect to see those same pressures continue to exist
