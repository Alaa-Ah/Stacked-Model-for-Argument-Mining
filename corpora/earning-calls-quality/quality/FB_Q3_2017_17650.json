So we need both technology and people for this. And the best articulation of this that I can make is that today, AI has different strengths than people do.

So earlier in the year, when we were working on problems like seeing issues when people were going live, there was this really serious issue around people with self-harm and in some cases suicide on Live, and we made an investment in AI tools and in dramatically increasing the staffing of the team that was working on that and brought the amount of time to review those Live videos down through a combination of those things to \u2013 I think it's under 10 minutes now.
