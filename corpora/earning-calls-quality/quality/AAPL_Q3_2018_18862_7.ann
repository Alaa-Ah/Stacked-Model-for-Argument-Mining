2AxM4ublV3 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 647 893 Yeah, Shannon, we feel great about the results on iPhone, up 20%, and if you look for the cycle, by the cycle, I mean Q1, Q2 and Q3, we've had on an average weekly basis, growth in units of sort of mid single digit and ASP growth of double digit.
ntm2mK1DHi CLAIM-Fact 894 995 And so if you, and look at iPhone X in particular, it's the most innovative smartphone on the market.
LlbDh8g6C9 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 996 1178 We priced it at a level that represented the value of it and we could not be happier that it has been the top selling iPhone since the launch, and so we feel terrific about iPhone X.
i4a5Y0kKZ0 CLAIM-Reformulated 1179 1418 If you look at the sort of the top of our line together, and by that I mean the iPhone X, the 8 and the 8 Plus, they are growing very nicely, as you can probably tell from looking at the ASP and we couldn't be happier with how that's gone.
MqFhdKLnKh PREMISE-Fact 1664 1840 At the unit level, the iPhone SE had a difficult comp to the year-ago quarter and so, when we changed some of the configurations, memory configurations in the year-ago quarter.
m5Hj49Ruec PREMISE-RealExample 1841 2088 If you look at it on a geographic basis, the top three selling phones in urban China were iPhone, where iPhone X was number one and has been for a couple of quarters, and iPhones make up three of the top five smartphones in the U.S., UK and Japan.
CMLV9L6lDf CLAIM-Fact 2089 2360 And so it's difficult sometimes to get a read over exactly what's happening in the market, but given the industry numbers that we've seen, it's clear that we picked up global market share and picked up market share in several countries, not only iPhone, but iPad as well.
ZRhZraS3Uf CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1419 1663 And so I think in this cycle, we've learned that customers want innovative products and we sort of already knew that in other cycles and other points in times, but it just puts an exclamation point by that I believe with looking at the results.
gMcfBWm_6s NON-ARG 2790 2817 Yeah, it's a good question.
EeblRp3y2b NON-ARG 2818 2828 Thank you.
cYUIXRC9Tj NON-ARG 2921 2974 I mentioned how iPhone X and the iPhones are selling.
_jjIWz3SVc CLAIM-Fact 2975 3254 We did pick up share in iPhone and iPad, but if you look more holistically at our complete line, we had double digit growth from services to iPad to iPhone and to our other product category which the watch did extremely well, and so there are lots of good things happening there.
JDLxxV_wEq NON-ARG 3255 3382 In terms of the tariffs themselves, maybe I could sort of take a step back because I'm sure some people have questions on this.
bvgVn32-MC PREMISE-Fact 2829 2920 This is the fourth consecutive quarter that we've had double digit growth in Greater China.
DztH0cUR2O PREMISE-Fact 3383 3574 And our view on tariffs is that they show up as a tax on the consumer and wind up resulting in lower economic growth and sometimes can bring about significant risk of unintended consequences.
K7x_Pu8b_O CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3575 3915 That said, the trade relationships and agreements that the U.S. has between the U.S. and other major economies are very complex and it's clear that several are in need of modernizing, but we think that in the vast majority of situations that tariffs are not the approach to doing that and so we're sort of encouraging dialogue and so forth.
4je5pEHaPx NON-ARG 3916 4164 In terms of the tariffs that have been imposed or have exited the comment period – I think there's one that's exiting today – there have been three of those and maybe I can walk through those briefly just to make sure everybody is on the same page.
oegT7YLrxq PREMISE-Fact 4165 4227 The first was the U.S. imposed a tariff on steel and aluminum.
tybq1o9KEh NON-ARG 4269 4317 That started I believe at the beginning of June.
nhrxc-XPoT PREMISE-Statistic 4318 4486 There have been two other tariffs that have totaled about $50 billion of goods from China that have either been implemented or exiting the comment period in this month.
vT1Cm4sIIG NON-ARG 4487 4519 I think the latest one is today.
a7sk1jNhoo CLAIM-Fact 4520 4615 If you look at those three tariffs, none of our products were directly affected by the tariffs.
S2CKTDkudw PREMISE-Statistic 4616 4737 There is a fourth tariff which includes goods valued at $200 billion, also focused on goods that are imported from China.
NM6x3uTWam NON-ARG 4738 4773 That one is out for public comment.
KwmmCOIkbd NON-ARG 4774 4947 Probably like everyone else, we're evaluating that one and we'll be sharing our views of it with the administration and so forth before the comment period for that one ends.
TKnhAUzMPa NON-ARG 4948 5226 It's actually a tedious process in going through it because you not only have to analyze the revenue products, which are a bit more straightforward to analyze, but you also have to analyze the purchases that you're making through other companies that are not related to revenue.
AByodh4paR NON-ARG 5227 5404 Maybe they're related to data centers and this sort of thing and so we're going through that now and we'll be sharing our results later on those and feeding back public comment.
DQwIJ2qqa1 NON-ARG 5608 5686 And so that, and we're not even trying to quantify that, to be clear about it.
PCeITSjCDf NON-ARG 5405 5607 Of course the risk associated with more of a macroeconomic issue such as an economic slowdown in one or more countries or currency fluctuations that are related to tariffs is very difficult to quantify.
lt-xPKuqC_ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 5687 5781 All of this said, we're optimistic, as I've been the whole time, that this will get sorted out
xF7zfBJk60 PREMISE-Fact 5782 6056 because there is an inescapable mutuality between the U.S. and China that sort of serves as a magnet to bring both countries together, that each country can only prosper if the other does and of course the world needs both U.S. and China to prosper for the world to do well.
nyyZJ7J7EE CLAIM-Reformulated 6057 6199 That said, I can't predict the future, but I am optimistic that the countries will get through this and we are hoping that calm heads prevail.
CM9ecqRAul NON-ARG 4228 4268 That was many, many different countries.
GmEXGXyLXJ NON-ARG 6213 6233  Thank you, Shannon.
icePygebjH NON-ARG 6234 6274 Could we have the next question, please?
