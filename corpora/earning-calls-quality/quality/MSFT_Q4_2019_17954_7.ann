BMyVndiAMR NON-ARG 743 749 Great.
_mWAyykNj0 CLAIM-Fact 750 944 Heather, let me -- on gross margin, over a long-term period and intelligent cloud, given the expansive TAM and the growth opportunity we see, it will create gross margin pressure over long-term.
7q8u20ACdb CLAIM-Opinion(view) 945 1102 Now over the next period, especially in H1, we continue to see -- expect to see very good hybrid percentage and execution, which help to offset some of that.
DKz18bIpt4 CLAIM-Fact 1297 1435 But of course a lot of opportunity in terms of gross margin dollar growth and of course operating margin dollar growth as we move forward.
QkVpv0R8Dh CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1436 1508 When it comes to our build out, Heather, I tend to think two components.
vr5q6yWYwD CLAIM-Fact 1509 1601 The majority of our capital expenditures is actually in server equipment, it's new capacity.
lsLPTjgAXI CLAIM-Fact 1602 1662 It's not necessarily in the overall geo footprint build out.
G1TPRNarAl CLAIM-Fact 1663 1760 We will of course continue to do that where it makes sense and where opportunity presents itself.
DBnV1iYYrp CLAIM-Fact 1761 1879 We do a very good job in terms of supply chain and being able to -- be able to get those up and running quite quickly.
pqBje4hMxw CLAIM-Reformulated 1880 1999 But the majority of the investment today is continuing to build capacity inside existing incredibly large data centers.

hhMQoVwOG6 NON-ARG 2084 2115 Operator, next question please.
8nEgn75oY3 CLAIM-Reformulated 1103 1296 So even as we continue to see Azure gross margin improvement at the IaaS and PaaS layer, just given the TAM and our opportunities, it will create long-term pressure on that gross margin number.
