-6b1URCmHf PREMISE-Fact 857 898 A year ago, Q3 was actually a little low.
-HUin9X-TA PREMISE-Other 899 1163 So on the year-over-year basis, I think it pops a little bit, Mark, when on really a sequential basis I actually don't think, to me, it looks out of sorts, especially with the type of demand we're seeing, not just for Azure, but across all of the cloud components.
R66ko19gns PREMISE-Statistic 1164 1274 Those growth rates really at 58% on that total cloud number, it's pretty good demand signal on a global basis.
y85KC5zH27 PREMISE-Fact 1275 1367 So I hear you on a year-over-year basis, but Q3 was a little funny a year ago on that front.
IwTDfwKr-E CLAIM-Opinion(view) 766 856 I actually didn't think of it as a significant change in trajectory from what we expected.
Zo46kVpnHh NON-ARG 1383 1477 And we continue to really monitor the actual equipment in that supply chain and what have you.
rayxdAKzDk NON-ARG 1478 1567 And if anything, there's a lot of automation and demand sensing capability we have there.
_4QXD3VmEr NON-ARG 1581 1586 Yeah.
kyTpVwsWYG CLAIM-Fact 1587 1776 And I would say, Mark, while I appreciate your point that it takes – and we do build data centers in advance, the majority of the cost obviously in a data center is in the equipment inside.
gALqmdVpWQ CLAIM-Fact 1777 1846 And so, while this really is – the majority of this spend is servers.
