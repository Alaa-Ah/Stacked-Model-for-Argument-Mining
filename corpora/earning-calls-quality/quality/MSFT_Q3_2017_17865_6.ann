Gd1Q3IWFgg NON-ARG 654 660 Great.
NP-FepPkfS NON-ARG 661 771 On ASC 606, we will talk about it in detail actually on May 10 in terms of the timing and what you can expect.
fRqXORrZTq NON-ARG 772 907 You will also note in the 10-Q this quarter, we do give a look at the initial impact on an annual basis, using last year as an example.
F4d4TmUfdt CLAIM-Fact 908 1027 The biggest difference on an annual basis with the adoption of ASC 606 will really just be the change from Windows OEM.
xpIfUP_aYK PREMISE-Fact 1028 1163 Now what we will talk about in more detail is that the quarter-to-quarter results in any given year will be a little bit more volatile.
MaFaiPmStX PREMISE-Fact 1164 1300 But over any annual period, the biggest difference will really just be the change in some ways back to how we thought about OEM revenue.
NHcxitzVPo CLAIM-Reformulated 1301 1344 So that's what I would think of on ASC 606.
OCzuzEHFKC NON-ARG 1405 1424 Windows, I'm sorry.
p_H-XHKNUt NON-ARG 1425 1463 I answered them in the opposite order.
PBE5ktyFeO CLAIM-Fact 1464 1607 And on the Windows pricing, which we talked about, we do and always have worked with Windows SKUs as we release new products and add new value.
LGFYMlhLkB PREMISE-Fact 1608 1670 This quarter, we had a bit of a mix shift to a higher-end SKU.
4Gv3ufPJVs PREMISE-Fact 1671 1777 And starting in April, we've introduced other SKUs that have more value in them at lower processing specs.
3xqrfWR4td PREMISE-Fact 1778 1837 And so what you'll continue to see is that would normalize.
qWw-KTkmlz PREMISE-Fact 1838 2034 Even though we saw some high-end SKUs this quarter do well, I would expect in Q4 to have the normal breadth of those SKUs and revert back to looking much more like the commercial PC market itself.
