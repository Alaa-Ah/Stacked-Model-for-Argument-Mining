s75wPlh0sS NON-ARG 759 764 Okay.
CHxTfowH-O NON-ARG 765 778 Thanks, Mark.
vkuimL88_x NON-ARG 779 885 Yeah, let me talk a little bit about guidance and I'll incorporate the answer to the fulfillment question.
ytznc0uZ4h PREMISE-Statistic 886 1054 So, you'll notice on the top line guidance of $31 billion to $33.5 billion or 22% to 32% growth incorporates the Prime Day results and I can talk more about that later.
xstH_PYBTo CLAIM-Fact 1055 1096 But Prime Day was very successful for us.
utUm5PU-Pz PREMISE-Statistic 1097 1245 It was up 60% on a worldwide basis over the prior year, and it was also a record day for our Amazon devices, as well as sellers and customers alike.
FpKjCb8tBt PREMISE-Fact 1246 1385 In the bottom line, you'll need to remember that Q3 is a typically a lower operating income quarter as we prepare for Q4, the holiday peak.
qxqbkm_Z8h PREMISE-Statistic 1386 1489 It's a little bit more exaggerated this year in that we're opening 18 fulfillment centers this quarter.
bkYO6f980c PREMISE-Statistic 1490 1553 To put that in perspective, we launched six in Q3 of last year.
g3V_uhBIyJ PREMISE-Statistic 1554 1723 This will bring us up to 21 net FCs for the year by the end of Q3 and that compares with 10 fulfillment centers for the first three quarters of last year on a net basis.
TwuZpcPYPl NON-ARG 1724 1757 So, why are we expanding so much?
vrMSNjw6NH PREMISE-Fact 1758 1943 If you remember back to Q4 and the capacity constraints we had in Q4, primarily due to really strong FBA growth, we talked a lot in the Q4 call about the operational cost of that in Q4.
vFkwHrBgYa PREMISE-Fact 1944 2046 Customers well taken care of, but we had additional fulfillment costs from being so tight on capacity.
RoTdm1rIru PREMISE-Statistic 2047 2309 This year, with that in mind and then knowing that our growth rate is actually accelerating on a unit basis, we are – Q2 was 28% unit growth for paid units, but fulfilled by – units Fulfilled by Amazon is much higher than that due to the growth of Prime and FBA.
FPB6L-A6MZ PREMISE-Statistic 2310 2490 That compares with last year in Q2 when we saw 22% unit growth, so we're 600 basis points faster growth in Q2 this year than last year and that 22% last year turned into 26% in Q4.
khzJxcfzQu CLAIM-Fact 2536 2689 So a lot of data points there, but the bottom line is that there's a large step up in the amount of fulfillment capacity in Q2 – excuse me, Q3 versus Q2.
NpF1mJjRfA PREMISE-Fact 2491 2535 So it ramped up in the back end of the year.
LC4jAd3H3Q CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2690 2753 There's a couple of other factors while I'm at it for guidance.
ZoOc-re0lo PREMISE-Fact 2754 2863 We are also nearly doubling our content spend in the second half of this year versus the second half of 2015.
LCUYKIXan9 PREMISE-Fact 2864 2975 We have a great slate of new Amazon Originals coming out later this year, both in the U.S. and internationally.
AOjwjNfZqq PREMISE-Fact 2976 3107 And we're nearly tripling our number of new Amazon Original shows – TV shows and movies compared with the second half of last year.
B0vPth_lRj CLAIM-Fact 3108 3179 There are other investments certainly that are increasing sequentially.
Q1ZDvIWngL PREMISE-Fact 3180 3343 I'd point to India and AWS, but primarily the two biggest issues in Q3 guidance I would say are the operational ramp and also the increase in digital content spend
u8C6RKAuag NON-ARG 3359 3518 And, Mark, to follow up on the other question, our net sales guidance anticipates approximately 30 basis points of favorable impact from foreign exchange rates
