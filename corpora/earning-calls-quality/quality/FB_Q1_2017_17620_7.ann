2ibRCPgw2Z NON-ARG 1701 1769 And I think Mark touched on the question of business model here, and
Y7clgLljtz CLAIM-Fact 1770 1807 our focus really is on revenue share.
6h04P3VbZe PREMISE-Fact 2063 2217 In terms of why mid-roll is preferable to pre-roll, Facebook is well suited for shorter-form content where we're ranking things to be longer-form as well.
_9JWjtRjY5 PREMISE-Fact 2218 2300 So we're ranking longer-form video, but that's still relatively short video views.
eka2jUrn3V CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2301 2368 And for that reason, we think mid-roll is a better user experience.
GauByxsKul PREMISE-Fact 1808 1936 We'll be investing to kick-start the ecosystem with content, so derisking it for some of our content partners to start off with,

khKfqgZjjP NON-ARG 1302 1483 And then the long-term goal is actually not to be paying for specific content like that, but doing a revenue share model once the whole economy around video on Facebook is built up.
oXyFbwUhcY NON-ARG 1484 1683 But we're working on that, and I think we'll probably look at different pieces of content like this around the world, but at this point don't feel like any specific one of them is a must-have for us.
hXxRCbHZtr NON-ARG 2386 2440  Operator, I think we have time for one last question.
