T_mAxUh58g NON-ARG 825 863 Let me start with your CapEx question.
_JytjyPXub PREMISE-Statistic 1002 1128 Those totaled $9.5 billion in the trailing 12 months, and it was up 7% from the 12-month period ending this quarter last year.
wD8WWgfX74 PREMISE-Statistic 1129 1183 I will point out that the prior year was $6.1 billion.
wTpwsnx6Mp PREMISE-Statistic 1184 1558 So we have stepped up investment, although it did not go up as much year-over-year this quarter, we are still spending almost $10 billion on what essentially is fulfillment capacity in support of really strong growth, unit growth and FBA, and global expansion and then also on AWS, additional capacity for existing customers as they grow their business and also new regions.
_amPXTZuxQ CLAIM-Fact 1559 1633 We've been working and continue to work very hard on capital productivity.
9x_X0FcszR CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1634 1858 It's very important to us, and I attribute a good piece of the ability to keep that at a modest growth rate year-over-year to our capital efficiency, and better purchasing across all capital and capital leases quite frankly.
wV-bIj0j5Z PREMISE-Statistic 1859 1905 But again, we are spending almost $10 billion.
LAMVC3RDwa NON-ARG 1925 1952 And, Stephen, this is Phil.
D2bPN81atq NON-ARG 1953 2041 Just to jump on the usage growth comment, we continue to see really strong usage growth.
mdsCC_BOXu NON-ARG 2042 2325 We are not in the business of raising prices, we lower prices for AWS, so there can be mix for products, but by and large, if you see our revenue growth, know that we are also lowering prices which means that by math, we are typically going to be growing usage at a very strong rate.
r6fA3mqeXI NON-ARG 2326 2359 So I just wanted to jump on that.
bwLuzpgjYT NON-ARG 863 1002  So we like to look at both capital expenditures and capital leases because they are both essentially levels with our level of investment. 
LJCqmqWbNN NON-ARG 1905 1911  So...
