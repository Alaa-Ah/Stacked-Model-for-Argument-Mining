r1DrfIsyC0 NON-ARG 57 82 And on virtual reality...
wwXZJCyw-C NON-ARG 100 140 Mark has a second part of that question.
Rck9JtmU7m PREMISE-Fact 165 412 So on virtual reality here, I think the big picture is that every 10 to 15 years or so there is a major new computing paradigm, right, whether that's DOS and then Windows and kind of desktop UI and then web browsers and now mobile phones and apps.
QHR8bLdNpf CLAIM-Opinion(view) 413 480 So it strikes me as inevitable that that progression will continue.
hSUzMc7xN_ PREMISE-Fact 481 605 And each one gets to be more natural to interact with, more natural gestures for controlling, more immersive, more portable.
AaJFdnsglM CLAIM-Reformulated 606 716 So I think it strikes me as very likely that the next one is going to be around virtual and augmented reality.
pBhosw6dme CLAIM-Fact 717 749 So we're investing a lot in this
ArwlUMEv3q PREMISE-Fact 750 842 because, frankly, we haven't to date been a hardware company or an operating system company.
a0phh8XuNy PREMISE-Hypothesis 843 1007 And we think that we need to build up a lot of different muscles in order to be competitive and be able to succeed in that space and to be able to shape that space.
cQCUYzMdsF PREMISE-Fact 1248 1293 I mean, iOS and Android came out around 2007.
FeM_8anvmd PREMISE-Fact 1294 1337 We were really small company at that point.
nwWu5mM34n PREMISE-Fact 1338 1390 So that just wasn't a thing that we were working on.
lJA_etmODl PREMISE-Other 1391 1545 But now I think we're living in a world where â€“ the way that I think about this is that people should really be at the center of how we design technology.
e8rc64AN3s PREMISE-Other 1546 1583 It shouldn't be designed around apps.
ym9l4MKb45 PREMISE-Other 1584 1669 It should be designed around our relationships because that's what matters to people.
IWUZ90RrgC PREMISE-Fact 1670 1714 And that's not the world we're on on mobile.
qbrw3BYbJF CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1715 1843 So I really am very committed to this idea of making sure that the next platform reflects those values that Facebook stands for.
LBOYkF5Heu CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1844 1889 I think this is going to be an exciting year.
oqvuKEvbVA CLAIM-Reformulated 1933 2134 We have the prototype and the developer kit around the higher-end stand-alone coming out as well, and we're doing a number of other things that I think are going to be quite exciting over time as well.
qjzzxXMcRF NON-ARG 2135 2180 But that's how I think about the whole space.
qTjWQO_s69 NON-ARG 2183 2234 don't know exactly when it's going to be a big deal
erkepZitz7 NON-ARG 2236 2395 When we started talking about this, I said that I thought that this was going to be a 10-year journey before this was really a very mainstream, major platform.
ZOsaE4k3fY NON-ARG 2396 2535 And I think the reality is Facebook needs to be investing before it is a big thing in order to build some of the muscles to be competitive.
Ubl6An6jf3 CLAIM-Reformulated 2536 2621 We're committed to doing that because I think that this is important for our mission.
AkpHpCoykF PREMISE-Fact 1008 1247 One of my great regrets in how we've run the company so far is I feel like we didn't get to shape the way that mobile platforms developed as much as would be good because they were developed contemporaneously with Facebook early on, right.
KP5I6k35qC PREMISE-Fact 1890 1932 As you mentioned, Oculus Go is coming out.
