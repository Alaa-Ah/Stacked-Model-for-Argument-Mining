t1b3bap9Gy NON-ARG 860 865 Sure.
3gFpBI8Odl NON-ARG 866 890 Let me start with video.
8M2Mhm6GyB NON-ARG 891 919 And I just want to be clear.
0R9l-jgkvu CLAIM-Fact 920 1000 We're going to continue to invest in video and increase that investment in 2018.
mHjLbJ22r5 NON-ARG 1001 1033 And why are we going to do that?
LwtOsdfeph PREMISE-Fact 1034 1158 It's because the video business is having great results with our most important customer base, which is our Prime customers.
JSmQYCMFGV PREMISE-Fact 1159 1302 It continues to drive better conversion of free trials, higher membership renewal rates for existing subscribers and higher overall engagement.
Bn-cCdHBsa PREMISE-Fact 1303 1415 We're seeing the engagement go up year-after-year in video and also music and a lot of the other Prime benefits.
9I310hF42g PREMISE-Fact 1416 1485 We also know Prime members who watch video also spend more on Amazon.
7C7VAiXREB PREMISE-Fact 1486 1761 And we have a lot of data where that's the advantage we have is that we see the viewing patterns, and we also see the sales patterns, so we can tie the two together and understand which video resonates with Prime members, which video doesn't, and make mid course corrections.
tFjtICo_21 CLAIM-Reformulated 1762 1783 So we always do that.
9A9SyOIj3y NON-ARG 1784 1947 We're always changing the emphasis and looking for those more impactful shows, more shows that resonate better with our customer base, and things they want to see.
T-mFb-kAFM PREMISE-Fact 1948 2142 So that will always be an important part of our Prime offer, and we'll continue to use the data that we have to make better and better decisions about where to invest our dollars in Prime Video.
gj48eKZsNz CLAIM-Fact 2143 2317 So we remain very bullish on the video business, and we're looking forward to a lot of interesting new projects at the back-end of this year and also lined up into next year.
2XLZEd6qnp NON-ARG 2318 2373 On the, sorry, the second comment was, oh, the overlap.
An0A4hcEFg NON-ARG 2374 2378 Yes.
YvOw6eCG5N NON-ARG 2676 2710 We're not sure how it'll play out.
Nd--ktO-RT NON-ARG 2828 3006 We know customers are going to buy, just like in the physical world, sometimes you go to a convenience store, sometimes you go to a supermarket, sometimes you go to a superstore.
pQpEuUBrTg NON-ARG 3007 3091 Sometimes you need things within an hour, sometimes you can wait days for shipments.
bulAvNjUnY NON-ARG 3092 3258 So there's no one paradigm for all customer engagement, and we're looking for the ones that resonate best with customers and we're going to continue to work on those.
QmCjnWFlpT NON-ARG 2379 2581 So Whole Foods, I think I mentioned this earlier, but we definitely see commonality and overlap with the Whole Foods business as well as Amazon in total, but specifically Prime Now and also AmazonFresh.
hptdQTwMaz NON-ARG 2582 2675 And we're going to work to see how we expand those offerings, and in some cases combine them.
nCJR6HIFn7 NON-ARG 2711 2827 But we're going cooperate across those different customer touch points and trying to make them better for customers.
