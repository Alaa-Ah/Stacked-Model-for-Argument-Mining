And then secondly, probably for Sheryl, for Ad Breaks to scale, it appears that content creators need to adapt their programming for this, and of course, users need to engage with the ads.

So I think your basic point is right, that the reason why we started working on Marketplace and the tab around that is because when we were exploring what the biggest use cases were of Groups, we uncovered that a very large number of people, hundreds of millions, use Groups to buy and sell different things. And so these whole communities have formed, which was somewhat surprising to us honestly, because we hadn't developed that product specifically for buying and selling. It was for group communication and that's what people were using it for. So we decided hey, we're going to put together a team that's going to invest in making this actually good for buying and selling and see how much we can grow that economy.

These are groups that upon joining, they become one of the things that you spend the most time with on Facebook, one of the most important parts of your experience, and a really fundamental part of your real-world support structure. So we look that that and we ask the question of hey, if 100 million people are in those very meaningful groups today, can we get that to be 1 billion people over next several years?
