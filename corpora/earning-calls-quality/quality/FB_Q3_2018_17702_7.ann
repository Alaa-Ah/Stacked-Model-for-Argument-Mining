2LrOx7XoBl CLAIM-Opinion(view) 352 467 I think, I guess, if you're talking about DAU and MAU, Europe is stable on that front in terms of Facebook overall.
-IacO39Utb PREMISE-Fact 468 605 The accounting methodology change did affect how Europe sequential growth rate came in, but really stable if you kind of take that aside.

nN2fgiRkh8 PREMISE-Fact 814 1125 So I think we're still seeing good growth in Europe on the revenue front, and a lot of the similar dynamics playing out in Europe as in the rest of the world where you see good impression growth opportunity, especially in areas like Instagram and Stories contributing to overall ability to drive revenue growth.
