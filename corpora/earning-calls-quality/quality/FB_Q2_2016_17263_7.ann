c-wmtFr2wK CLAIM-Reformulated 2420 2535 They have an increased opportunity to grow, and that's why we think our growth to-date continues to be broad-based.
8MNUoaj-m- PREMISE-RealExample 1401 1491 So to share one example, Jack In The Box use our Canvas ads, which are very immersive ads.
1jQFarYSZk PREMISE-RealExample 1492 1590 They're really good for a brand experience, to roll out a new menu item, their Double Jack burger.
HqqmOfxA4U PREMISE-RealExample 1591 1744 They worked with agencies Horizon, David & Goliath and Adaptly, and they targeted millennials on Facebook to create two different custom audience groups.
dVhMNS6wvx CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1199 1332 And I think that's because we have a combination of the creative and the story telling, so the art with the science of the targeting.
rg525OELPb CLAIM-Fact 1333 1400 And when people do that well together, you see great opportunities.
UrKmRcE8ra CLAIM-Reformulated 2188 2419 And so I think what you're seeing is that across all of the objectives people have from brand marketers to direct response to SMBs to developers, as our ad products get more sophisticated, our targeting and measurements get better.
DcB9_3ZQ1N PREMISE-Statistic 1963 2187 They had an average view rate of 23 seconds across those Canvas ads, so clearly people were really engaged in the brand experience of the ads, and they had a 13-point lift in add recall and a 9-point lift in purchase intent.

-gGiMHDIc8 NON-ARG 2553 2605 Yeah, and, Brian, I'll take the Live video question.
hOctMTYBYb NON-ARG 2606 2655 It's hard to compete with the Double Jack burger.
tvS-q0MiQh NON-ARG 2656 2702 But in terms of Live video, it's really early.
