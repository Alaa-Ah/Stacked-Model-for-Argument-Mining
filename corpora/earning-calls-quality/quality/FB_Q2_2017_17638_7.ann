9IX1ERGhZ8 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 646 714 This is certainly something that I'm really excited about long term.
ZNNI0jSq6g PREMISE-Fact 715 985 Not only does it have the possibility of being the next major computing platform, AR and VR together, but I think it has the possibility of being much more social and intuitive and natural than some of the devices that we have today, whether they're computers or phones.
5YjxLVVLhO CLAIM-Reformulated 986 1030 So that's why I'm really excited about that.
CpFNxt-imU PREMISE-Fact 1031 1245 When you think about AR glasses, the technology and science to build an experience that would be both comfortable to wear and something that people would actually want to wear out in public, that doesn't exist yet.
1hYPf30c7G CLAIM-Fact 1246 1313 So there's a lot of foundational work that needs to get done there.
pKq1b2jeZB NON-ARG 1751 1947 But look, if I was just saying that video is going to be the primary driver or one of the big drivers over the next few years and Messenger maybe after that, I think AR is quite far down the road.
uHze_IMniJ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2235 2554 So I think that that's a thing that we take seriously, whether it's connectivity and making sure that people actually all around the world get to enjoy and benefit from the opportunities that the Internet has or the improvements that come from AI, or eventually upgrading the computing platforms that we all get to use.
GVLMWH4YUA PREMISE-Fact 1948 2234 But when you're running an operation and serving people at this scale, I think you have a responsibility to invest in all these things that are downstream that could help shape and improve people's lives, because I don't think that there are that many other folks in the world who will.
wkhKgY54-k NON-ARG 2555 2600 This stuff doesn't just happen automatically.
yh42Vqoysd CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1314 1370 That's partially why I'm excited about doing the VR work
sk8ydHMGUL PREMISE-Fact 1371 1411 because it doesn't have that constraint.
oMnbyXirbk PREMISE-Fact 1412 1448 You're not wearing VR out in public.
18gl40TmkI PREMISE-Fact 1449 1554 But also recently, one of the things that we've seen is that there are a lot of AR experiences on mobile.
y72Ihazj6B CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1555 1750 So the work that we started talking about at F8 that we are releasing slowly over the course of the year is certainly one of the precursors for building out that ecosystem that I'm excited about.
XutT0-zkAy CLAIM-Reformulated 2601 2692 And someone in the world needs to focus on building it, and we want to play a role in that.
sjqiWlqwlr NON-ARG 2710 2728  Great, thank you.
