aQaUxpiqUc NON-ARG 523 528 Sure.
mbqHkaHgrG NON-ARG 529 550 I’ll take that, John.
yXc6sMK0ES NON-ARG 551 613 So on the ad load for Instagram Stories versus Instagram Feed.
A5EkoBnko6 CLAIM-Fact 614 666 I mean it’s hard to compare Stories exactly to Feed,
VoGABYcBlJ PREMISE-Fact 667 865 because there’s different characteristics of Stories versus Feed, because you have effectively rolls of video when people are posting lots of Stories, and the interstitials are in between the rolls.
XRM3f--C8r PREMISE-Fact 866 949 It’s a little bit different than Feed posts, so comparing apples and oranges a bit.
Wf1h3bRhBP CLAIM-Opinion(view) 950 1157 But we do have opportunities we think to increase effective ad load on Stories, where Instagram Feed and Facebook Feed are – we think the opportunities are much more limited to increase ad load going forward
ZSRh-2HnoM PREMISE-Fact 1159 1387 In terms of conversion rates, I’d probably just go back to the discussion that we had on pricing and the fact that we’ve got a lot of – we’ve got a lot of supply opportunity, and pricing is clearly lower on Stories than on Feed.
m0RRIf2d7G PREMISE-Fact 1388 1557 Part of that is due to the fact that we don’t have as many direct response formats in Stories, so that reduces the opportunities for conversion opportunities on Stories.
uAOQ-xrQJx CLAIM-Reformulated 1558 1675 And as we are more effective at getting direct response into Stories, that should improve, so some opportunity there.
Sdnml6ArTk CLAIM-Fact 1676 1774 On the CapEx guidance, this is really just about better visibility on how spend will come through.
YQ82b9wz-j CLAIM-Fact 1973 2024 We’re continuing to invest heavily in the business.
yWM1xXoOZP PREMISE-Fact 2025 2445 The capital intensity of the business over the last several years had come up, and part of what is driving that are real changes in the business as it relates to our opportunity to deploy capital against things like ads targeting as well as the fact that we’ve seen the user base growth shift to regions like Asia and we’re now building our CapEx to what’s effectively an Asian peak and so that’s a lower ARPU user base.
8tyHMA1Uwu CLAIM-Fact 2446 2614 So that does have some impact on capital intensity and part of the driver, where we’re seeing kind of capital intensity increase over the – over the past several years.
ca96sznP-1 PREMISE-Fact 1775 1821 A big component of CapEx’s data center builds.
jLVW8ubEHm PREMISE-Fact 1822 1972 Those are large complex projects, so the timing of that spend, we just get better visibility on as the year progresses, but no real change in outlook.
JrvJWlEVAr NON-ARG 2632 2681  Operator, we’re going to take one last question.
