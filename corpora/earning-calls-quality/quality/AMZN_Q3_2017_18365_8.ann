Zga8MwefQI NON-ARG 803 808 Sure.
eIyPw8T2lB NON-ARG 809 839 Let me start with the revenue.
zJFl0KW14L PREMISE-Statistic 840 895 So you're right, other revenue grew 58% in the quarter.
-oOEg1iLGO PREMISE-Fact 896 997 And that includes advertising services and other things such as our cobranded credit card agreements.
jmS_yOa-b1 PREMISE-Fact 998 1155 Advertising revenue continues to grow very quickly and its year-over-year growth rate is actually faster than the other revenue line item that you see there.
OXMwFAROzH CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1156 1233 But I would say, generally, we're very pleased with the advertising business.
mIxx6Huj4H CLAIM-Fact 1234 1335 Our goal here is to be helpful to consumers and help them make better shopping and selection choices.
LvOEmKQ9yB PREMISE-Other 1336 1456 We'll also provide â€“ and giving them targeted recommendations, so making it helpful for customers rather than intrusive.
CpXnLHvy50 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1457 1620 And then we believe that by creating that growth (17:19) and engaging advertising experience with the customers, it will also maximize success for our advertisers.
zKV_2GwVb8 CLAIM-Fact 1621 1916 So, it's an important part of the flywheel and so it's the traffic and the customers, especially the Prime customers that come to the site, are really the ones that we can use to help them select items and use advertising to help make their decisions more informed when they're picking products.
BmEmZ0uXDk NON-ARG 1917 2095 On the international, yeah, I can't split it, the effects, but I will tell you again, it is international expansion and primarily in India where we're continuing to add benefits.
DBO5AOoDj6 CLAIM-Fact 2465 2553 So, a lot of positive momentum and investment going on in India, very pleased with that.
zPmbJkaFnp PREMISE-Fact 2554 2619 We also recently announced Echo and Alexa are available in India.
4LBEVRUpYM CLAIM-Fact 2620 2680 So that should be well received by the Indian consumer base.
QspIosgHsU PREMISE-Fact 2681 2871 But excluding India and Souq, the rest is the Prime benefits and the continued growth in the other countries that we have been in for a while, continue to roll out Prime Now and AmazonFresh.
ZgvlUBEQH6 CLAIM-Fact 3272 3320 So, there's a lot of different influences there.
z3x-4p2MXm CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3346 3393 We believe that it's resonating with customers.
amCfD2n28f CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3394 3468 So, we will continue to invest and think that we have a good path forward.
7dlPi0-Urd PREMISE-Fact 2096 2249 And we launched Prime there a year ago, if you remember, and we've had more Prime members join in India than in any other country in the first 12 months.
4gFo7Pykcz PREMISE-Fact 2250 2363 We have free shipping on 10 million items there and we're continuing to add benefits; Prime Video, Amazon Family.
g2VgR77BvJ PREMISE-Fact 2364 2464 We had the first Prime Day there this year, Prime Music, Amazon Business is also expanding in India.
GhzM1g5qoB PREMISE-Fact 2872 3082 In video, if you remember in Q4 of last year, we launched Prime Video in over 200 countries globally, continue to build up not only the offerings, but also the engagement that we see from those Prime customers.
5X8lop3eHS PREMISE-Fact 3083 3271 So becoming more engaged and we're also doing the basic blocking, tackling of adding selection, especially FBA selection, increasing free shipping offers and also speed of shipping offers.
