A few years ago, we probably would\u2019ve rolled this out and tried to deal with issues as they came up with, but now part of our new approach of trying to be more proactive about social issues is trying to build in from the ground up, getting this right upfront. So the playbook is going to be work on getting the basics right, make sure that we have safety rights from the beginning.
