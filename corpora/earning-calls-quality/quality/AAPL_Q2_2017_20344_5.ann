JUtAAxLEGu NON-ARG 465 503 Yes, thanks for the question, Shannon.
1vQXxMB1Hs PREMISE-RealExample 662 843 And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus, we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before, compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus.
WN-2hDFUPj PREMISE-RealExample 844 886 Also, the Mac business did extremely well.
RvJcQNt6VQ PREMISE-Statistic 887 1003 The Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China, and we had extremely strong Services growth during the quarter in China.
OjYqeQ-4V6 PREMISE-Fact 1004 1094 As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall and in China.
4GVlcR5QiQ PREMISE-Statistic 1095 1184 They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter.
epP6eUTzA7 CLAIM-Fact 504 661 We saw in Q2 a performance that combined with Q1 to form the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year.
pKdcMXhY4k PREMISE-Statistic 1185 1326 And traffic – which for us is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell – traffic was up 27% year on year.
ywGBZFSvK1 NON-ARG 1414 1486 And so that's the set of things that went in our direction, so to speak.
83Aws70wcZ PREMISE-Fact 1327 1413 And now seven of our top ten highest traffic stores in the world are in Greater China.
leN9jvsIVl CLAIM-Fact 1814 1873 And so that's the set of things on the plus and minus side.
fwpEFLN9zO PREMISE-Statistic 1487 1574 On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind.
gL1JQrbYed PREMISE-RealExample 1575 1703 And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump.
p-WN37rA9v PREMISE-RealExample 1704 1813 Also, where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones.
Kp-7eRFvPX CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1997 2135 What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth, but improve – but make more progress.
uFWDzHs9NP CLAIM-Reformulated 2136 2206 And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there.
Ll_H_JSmpT CLAIM-Reformulated 2207 2271 And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there.
7ORM8F_wwl CLAIM-Fact 1874 1920 We did perform about where I thought we would.
DAPGz3pLsm PREMISE-Fact 1921 1996 At least I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter, and it was.
tFTqv2nsLf NON-ARG 2890 2945 Shannon, you know how we run our capital return program
cDuBdqjxOj NON-ARG 3665 3825 The program that we're announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country, and there's a lot that still needs to happen there, and we'll see.
SV52wQCjNG NON-ARG 3826 3885 Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change.
8l2P2DmTxJ NON-ARG 3592 3664 It's difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen.
JHkxTi25wk CLAIM-Fact 2947 3003 We've been pretty consistent during the last five years.
ah048OMnPn PREMISE-Fact 3004 3132 Essentially for the last five years, the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors.
8dOuqi_N6k PREMISE-Fact 3133 3271 That's what we've done with the program until now, and the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction.
u1JxerieKP PREMISE-Fact 3367 3454 We're in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have.
1Gsby0H4J3 PREMISE-Statistic 3455 3591 And given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of the free cash flow to investors.
pDk3OkWOk4 PREMISE-Fact 3272 3323 We know how much we need to invest in the business.
hLExaKDWDo PREMISE-Fact 3324 3366 We will never underinvest in the business.
