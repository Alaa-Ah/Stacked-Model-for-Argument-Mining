UucO8IlML2 NON-ARG 752 757 Yeah.
rCRv1KpBkP NON-ARG 758 790 Lloyd, thanks for the questions.
q2AThKlZ3v NON-ARG 791 829 I'll take the advertising piece first.
LMYqpPwEW3 CLAIM-Fact 830 916 I mean, I think as I talked before, we're working on the improving usability of tools.
11o4bSPcFa CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1466 1720 I think we're learning and are a very data interested company and working with a lot of great brands to be able to develop better toolkits for them, understand what types of metrics they want to make them more successful based on what they're telling us.
2Z4ailhU8c CLAIM-Opinion(view) 917 1465 I mean, our priorities in the space, that's certainly one of them looking for ways to make smarter recommendations, addressing the needs of brands, automating activities, incenting new products and I think in all those regards in those priorities, we think there's some good growth to continue to come both in advertising for on our own properties, but also potentially beyond, over the longer term, so, but even as we look for advertising opportunities on places like Amazon.com, we think there's a lot of opportunity and a lot of experimentation.
c94Yqs9kOu NON-ARG 1734 1739 Yeah.
8rmuNGOc-o NON-ARG 1740 1854 And on transportation, I assume you're just talking about our expansion of Amazon deliveries and Amazon logistics.
AS1K7RULxb CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2123 2403 So during the quarter, it was a much bigger presence obviously year-over-year, so we're happy with that, both from a performance standpoint, the delivery estimate accuracy as we call it was very strong on our self-delivered products and also the cost profile is very good as well.
ODTJ3Mzju7 PREMISE-Fact 1855 2041 Again, we have great partners in place for our business and support globally, what we do is add capacity where we feel we need to speed up service or ensure demand, particularly at peak.
5XTuiEjOYV CLAIM-Fact 2042 2122 So we will continue to build out our DSP and flex and chip with Amazon programs.
