Overall what we have seen is the public cloud or cloud infrastructure makes it much more possible for businesses of all sizes and developers of all sizes to get at infrastructure with much less friction than ever before. I grew up in our server business in the past. We were definitely the one to democratize servers by bringing servers to small businesses. But when I think about what's happening for example in Office 365, where we are adding 50,000 small business customers who now get the most sophisticated server technology, but now as a SaaS service, that's what's really happening world over with all application categories and that's where the growth is. I don't know long-term whether there is a zero-sum equation, but right now and in the intermediate timeframe, we see in our case growth in both sides. And in our case the vision also we have for distributed cloud infrastructure is just that, it is distributed. So we don't think of our server as a legacy business. I think of it as the edge of our cloud. If you look at what we are doing with SQL, we will have the ability for any customer of SQL to stretch even a single table from between their on-premise to the cloud. Those are the kinds of things that we are excited about. But we clearly are seeing very rapid growth and adoption of our Azure cloud. But in our case there are two unique aspects. One is this true distributed hybrid. And second is we don't think of Azure in isolation.
