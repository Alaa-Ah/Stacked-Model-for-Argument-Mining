I mean, in terms of \u2013 in terms of what percentage of videos or ads, we're not breaking that out. I think what we said was that we're really pleased with the consumer adoption we're seeing.

We know that marketers love videos so there's a great opportunity here. It's still early. It's worth pointing out that, as Sheryl mentioned, video does displace other ads in News Feed. And let me just kind of speak to how that plays into pricing as well. Video is just a format that's bid into the auction. So video is effectively winning in the auction if it's higher priced. So if somebody's willing to pay more for a video, it's going to get served before another type of format ad. But there's not really a price differential you're paying for a video, it's just what are you willing to pay into the system.
