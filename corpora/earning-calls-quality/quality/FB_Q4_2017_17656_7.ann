orCJhhTN8E NON-ARG 684 695 Yes, Peter.
o-LZySNjDk NON-ARG 696 728 I'll take the second part first.
ERJDKbT7Ux PREMISE-Fact 729 917 We began to make changes around a number of different quality initiatives in the fourth quarter, so that affected metrics that we've talked about including both the time spent and the DAU.
BhZcp6Cu_- PREMISE-Fact 918 1044 But we continue to make changes to improve and to optimize around driving meaningful social interactions as Mark talked about.
K-6Tb8DRHi PREMISE-Fact 1045 1103 That's going to be an ongoing journey throughout the year.
YuTyms4Ivg CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1196 1255 So I'd expect we would continue to make changes and evolve.
72pILF-9Gu PREMISE-Fact 1104 1195 So there's no â€“ I don't think we ever are going to declare that we are done making changes.
UG2JE-Tc-I CLAIM-Fact 1273 1395 On the search opportunity, there's a growing number of searches on Facebook, but we're still a ways off from monetization.

uEG3wen-on PREMISE-RealExample 1609 2046 So we have multiple clients who will show an ad, a video ad to everyone in the U.S. for example or to a big cohort of people and then they'll follow up with an ad that target on either Instagram or Facebook to people who engage with that first that then they can follow up with the next team and we are seeing as businesses are increasingly measuring your ad spend in terms of their real ROI for sales that even within our own platforms.
Z-wu_HouL7 CLAIM-Reformulated 2047 2138 We can move people down that marketing funnel from demand generation to demand fulfillment.
