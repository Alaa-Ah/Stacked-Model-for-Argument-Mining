Satya, following up on the cloud discussion, recognizing that SaaS, PaaS, infrastructure as a service, hybrid are all related. But as Azure continues to grow fast and become a bigger part of the business, how should we think about the opportunities or the opportunity size for PaaS versus infrastructure as a service? PaaS is much smaller industry-wide today, but is the opportunity is big, bigger? How should we think about that?

IaaS growth comes because people already have existing code that they want to move over, and then they start extending by writing more PaaS because it's sort of more efficient for them to write new code and new apps in PaaS. So I think that depending on what. If you're bringing something over, your IaaS will be heavy first and then PaaS will grow. If you're starting new, you will have PaaS, which is going to be the first thing you do, but then you'll always find the need to go integrate with something that was already existing, existing data, existing code in a virtual machine. So I myself, in fact one of the things that Amy and I do, is when we think about our CapEx, we think about all these layers together. In fact we amortize our CapEx across all of these and we pay attention to margin and premium mix. Because what we have come to understand is customers, depending on where they start, how they start, have different mix profiles. So it's the all-up, as long as we're growing our premium services attach and margins for those remain strong, we feel that the mix can be different and it's okay.
