-LISDHnt3M NON-ARG 552 557 Sure,
rxc3WMD58I PREMISE-Fact 558 629 so search is an area that we've been working on for a while to improve.
v1HodXBLl3 PREMISE-Fact 630 687 I don't know what the most recent public stat is on that.
7xicOKKBhu PREMISE-Fact 688 740 So I'm not going to say a stat, but it's grown a lot
1fdkdwn1p4 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 742 994 So we're happy with that and we think that reflects that people are getting value from the search experience, which a lot of the growth comes from people searching for posts and content in the system, not just looking up people and pages in the system.
rcudWD8ypy NON-ARG 995 1022 So on search, there's that.
47lS7YL-XM CLAIM-Fact 1023 1153 And then of course, I think that search is often driven by what unique content is in a system and not just the ability to find it.
By2Kcnbw5Z PREMISE-Fact 1154 1302 So I think what people are going to search Facebook for are finding people and content that they know is on Facebook and that isn't in other places.
by4V6f0iLN NON-ARG 1486 1523 You asked about transactions as well.
wijUWD2pjl CLAIM-Fact 1524 1601 And we've spent a lot of time on this call talking about putting video first.
i5VyQfqb1x PREMISE-Fact 1602 1816 That has certainly been the biggest theme of the last quarter and is the biggest part of the product strategy for Facebook and Instagram and is a big part of the product strategy for Messenger and WhatsApp as well.
rbJ-4Zjhql CLAIM-Reformulated 1303 1485 And that I think is driving most of the volume today and I think can get us to be â€“ we're already one of the largest search engines in the world, but to be even bigger on that front.
ZrQvDOp_qg PREMISE-Fact 1817 2166 In terms of transactions, one of the big things that we see happening in messaging long term is that it's a great channel for people to interact with a business one on one and either do transactions in a private space or get support, or for businesses to reach out with very personally tailored messages and have an ongoing engagement with a person.
6XJBYS5snZ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2167 2226 So that's something that we're very excited about building.
gsXKVC4zjQ PREMISE-Fact 2227 2322 And that is going to be the business that we hope to build on Messenger and WhatsApp over time.
STvZC_PBOm CLAIM-Fact 2323 2356 So we're looking forward to that.
Ehw7kpb6tY NON-ARG 2357 2420 Marketplace I think is going to be a great example of this too.
OzOqlfNA5K PREMISE-Fact 2421 2563 What we're seeing in pages and marketers on Facebook is they want to both get awareness and drive all the way down to generating transactions,
WXHZBbkYRt CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2564 2620 and Marketplace I think is going to help people do that.
gM3Is7Vnuy PREMISE-Fact 2621 2851 We're starting with people being able to sell things and connect to other people who want to buy them, just like they've been doing in for-sale groups for many years, but we're excited to evolve this and grow it over time as well.
lvbiiqOkQZ NON-ARG 2869 2904  So thank you for joining us today.
mqToDRRXcW NON-ARG 2905 2976 We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you again.
