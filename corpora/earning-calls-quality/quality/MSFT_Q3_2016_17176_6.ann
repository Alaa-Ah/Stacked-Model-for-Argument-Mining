Udm72hpOL0 NON-ARG 822 855 I can start and then Amy can add.
uoilJY-MMk CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1175 1259 So we feel very good about that, which is users with in terms of coverage and usage.
j8tBzTU8pC PREMISE-Fact 1007 1107 And I talked about how the mobile end points has been growing and the mobile usage has been growing.
_XC1AvhULv PREMISE-Fact 1108 1174 I also talked about the 70 million monthly active users of Office.
oP7wU37dVD CLAIM-Fact 1730 1950 The other thing that I am also sort of excited about when it comes to Office 365 is for the first time, we're opening up Office 365 not just as a end-user and a enterprise tool in the service, but as a developer platform
hFh-H45kT7 PREMISE-Other 1952 2190 In its own right, we think of Office as perhaps one of the most strategic developer assets we have and with the Microsoft Graph API and what we see as activity around it, we think about the platform effects of that as also being very key.
li7hhdIwZU NON-ARG 2191 2290 So that's at least at the macro level how I look at it and, Amy, if you want to talk a little more.
TPSO-xrq3C PREMISE-Fact 856 1006 Overall the thing that we are most focused on with Office 365 is how do we make sure that we have the Office 365 end points everywhere and good usage.
uyfltpitLb PREMISE-Other 2440 2669 You'd expect to continue to see installed base growth as even some of the items I've talked about have more relevance and continue to make us the value prop higher even in small business, which is where you've seen the user adds.
_yp8pSJf29 CLAIM-Reformulated 2888 2954 Those are trends I'd expect to see obviously as we look into 2017.
Jgl6J7x-Z6 PREMISE-Other 2670 2887 I would continue to expect to see ARPU growth as we see E5 have its impact through the year and so think about these same dynamics still for us where we focus on new users and ARPU increases as we shift to Office 365.
mG3nMDdWIH CLAIM-Fact 1260 1372 The next place where we are very focused on is really the new scenarios and E5 is obviously a big element of it.
d-L8EwjX_5 PREMISE-Fact 1373 1434 I talked about in some detail the security value proposition.
WoNOZ3a3uK PREMISE-Fact 1435 1543 That is really showing a lot of good traction for us, but we're also seeing traction in analytics and voice.
xUTBsJfqgj CLAIM-Reformulated 1544 1729 So we're in the very early innings of E5, but the value proposition and the TAM or the total addressable market of those three scenarios is huge, and so we remain very excited about it.
1GYJN38s0_ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2304 2439 Again, I think the way that shows itself in our financial results is you'd expect to continue to see the strong mix shift to the cloud.
