fdpgTTJHBR NON-ARG 1019 1154 We're already working with 75 mobility partners that are principally in the U.S. but that's expanding quickly to international as well.
KyCEMcdFZl NON-ARG 1155 1281 And so, many of these companies have -- in some cases very large sales forces, in many cases the reasonable seize sales force.

D8anyqLvzA CLAIM-Fact 2253 2312 And so, we've been able to grow without the market growing.
oBcFXBNd0j PREMISE-Statistic 2042 2149 If you look at China, we grew from an iPhone point of view, Greater China, we grew 87% the market grew for.
nLEv4TLYmB PREMISE-Hypothesis 2150 2252 If you take iPhone out of the market number, the certain market x iPhone actually contracted slightly.

QJhrhHjMpa CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3619 3885 So, we're very bullish on it, and I would point out that we're investing in China not for next or the quarter after, or the quarter after, we're investing for the decades ahead and as we look at it our own views is that China will be Apple's top market in the world.
1MEFGjwGoR CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3028 3180 That said, I don't think it’s growing as fast as it was, but I also don't think that Apple's results are largely dependent on minor changes than growth.
