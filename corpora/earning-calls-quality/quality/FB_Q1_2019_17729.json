I\u2019ll take that, John. So on the ad load for Instagram Stories versus Instagram Feed. I mean it\u2019s hard to compare Stories exactly to Feed, because there\u2019s different characteristics of Stories versus Feed, because you have effectively rolls of video when people are posting lots of Stories, and the interstitials are in between the rolls. It\u2019s a little bit different than Feed posts, so comparing apples and oranges a bit. But we do have opportunities we think to increase effective ad load on Stories, where Instagram Feed and Facebook Feed are \u2013 we think the opportunities are much more limited to increase ad load going forward. In terms of conversion rates, I\u2019d probably just go back to the discussion that we had on pricing and the fact that we\u2019ve got a lot of \u2013 we\u2019ve got a lot of supply opportunity, and pricing is clearly lower on Stories than on Feed. Part of that is due to the fact that we don\u2019t have as many direct response formats in Stories, so that reduces the opportunities for conversion opportunities on Stories. And as we are more effective at getting direct response into Stories, that should improve, so some opportunity there. On the CapEx guidance, this is really just about better visibility on how spend will come through. A big component of CapEx\u2019s data center builds.

We\u2019re continuing to invest heavily in the business. The capital intensity of the business over the last several years had come up, and part of what is driving that are real changes in the business as it relates to our opportunity to deploy capital against things like ads targeting as well as the fact that we\u2019ve seen the user base growth shift to regions like Asia and we\u2019re now building our CapEx to what\u2019s effectively an Asian peak and so that\u2019s a lower ARPU user base.
