Thanks, guys for taking my question and congrats on a great close to a great year. I just wanted to focus in on M 365, particularly Satya your comments on Microsoft Teams. Really kind of two components for this question. How do you think about sort of why customers are adopting Teams, especially the larger ones that you highlighted at Ignite Conference. Is it the fact, let's say, single app with those combined features you talked about or is it the broader, you call it, Office experience? And then, I guess a question for Amy then off of that. When you think about sort of the relevance of Teams on a going forward basis to keep this migration up, E1, E3, E5 and then plus those add-ons that are associated with Teams like Calling etcetera, how critical is Teams to this -- to the long-term, call it, like, price migration here at Office and M 365?", "start": 125, "labels": ["QUESTION"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 998, "text": "Satya Nadella", "start": 984, "labels": ["REPRESENTATIVE"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 2828, "text": ": Yes. So, overall, I think there's no question this last fiscal year has been an absolute breakout year for Teams in terms of both the product innovation and most importantly at-scale deployment and usage that we\u2019re seeing. And I think, in fact unlike any other time other than Windows, we've not had this kind of platform effect. Office has obviously had very, very successful individual products that have been deployed broadly, but each of them was a singular tool. Perhaps SharePoint was the last time we had a platform effect of this kind. But Teams is -- transcends all that. It's the communications tool, it's the collaboration tool, it's the line of business tool for meetings as well as business process. And so, the amount of value creation for the customer by deployment is something that we ourselves are sort of really learning a lot each deployment, whether it's on the first line. The other point about Teams is just not limited to knowledge workers, which has been really the only place traditionally we play. Even our licenses to the non-knowledge workers were just mostly licenses of the tools we built for knowledge workers. Whereas now, we actually have specific value, which is in fact very valuable to those first line workers. And the thing that we have realized is, that businesses are in fact looking to spend more for those first line worker productivity. So we\u2019re in a very early innings of it, but we are pretty excited. The one other benefit, to sort of tease off with some of the comments Amy was making is that security compliance and governance is a huge issue for enterprise customers and commercial customers at scale.
