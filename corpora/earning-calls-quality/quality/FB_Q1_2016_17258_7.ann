FIZjNd2WWh PREMISE-Fact 526 750 So the biggest thing that we're focused on with artificial intelligence is building computer services that have better perception than people, so the basic human senses like seeing, hearing, language, core things that we do.
HxgU0Tj1JZ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 751 905 I think it's possible to get to the point in the next five to 10 years where we have computer systems that are better than people at each of those things.
Koco0oiDMM CLAIM-Fact 906 1026 That doesn't mean that the computers will be thinking or be generally better, but that is useful for a number of things.
edx2iO22qc PREMISE-RealExample 1027 1147 So for example, I talked about earlier, we are building this Moments app, so that way you can take photos on your phone.
D3bdX3RfXT PREMISE-Fact 1148 1331 And if you use this app, our face recognition can look at the photos that you take and suggest that you might want to share photos that you took with a friend in them with that person
gAfYZd_MET PREMISE-Fact 1333 1438 So that way, all the photos that might be of you and your friends' camera rolls, they can share with you.
GgrBGLbnFH PREMISE-Fact 1439 1603 Another example is just spam filtering and just making sure that we can actually read the content and understand what's interesting to you or not and not show that.
lWdpMQF2GM NON-ARG 1604 1694 One obvious thing I think over time is if you just look at the way that we rank News Feed,
S_-S78ggEF CLAIM-Fact 1695 2009 today we use some basic signals like who you're friends with and what pages you like as some of the most important things for figuring out what â€“ out of all of the millions and millions of pieces of content that are on Facebook, what we're going to show and what are going to be the most interesting things to you.
BQZFs0woy4 PREMISE-Fact 2010 2092 That's because today our systems can't actually understand what the content means.
8MSoOYEma0 PREMISE-Fact 2093 2353 We don't actually look at the photo and deeply understand what's in it or look at the videos and understand what's in it or read the links that people share and understand what's in them, but in the future we'll be able to, I think in a five or 10-year period.
kjbQFSz5et PREMISE-Fact 2354 2632 So all of these millions and millions of pieces content that are out there, whether or not you've added someone as a friend or have liked a page, we'll be able to know a lot better what types of things are going to be interesting to you to produce a much better feed of content.
Zg3Ua6SEe3 CLAIM-Fact 2633 2800 So that's just a basic example of where having human-level perception broadly is going to yield better experiences in a lot of the things that people care about today.
