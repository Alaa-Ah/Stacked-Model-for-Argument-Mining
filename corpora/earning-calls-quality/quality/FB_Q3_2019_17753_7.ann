O-CwGeJdB8 NON-ARG 655 660 Sure.
4J0_PFNWB5 NON-ARG 661 835 So look, I think some of what you might be asking about are the antitrust questions that are out there in the investigations and I can talk a bit about this, if it's helpful.
NfRM87nRgV NON-ARG 836 973 I mean, look, I think a lot of the antitrust questions that are out there that are going to be about our acquisition of Instagram, right.
l9Kbtdjea1 NON-ARG 974 1129 And some of that -- how that might affect other things that we do today, but -- so there's going to be a lot of scrutiny of that acquisition in particular.
2a8vv7WcBQ NON-ARG 1130 1297 And so I think if it's helpful I'll go back to what it was like at the time there when we did that acquisition just to kind of lay out how we were thinking about this.
2hB5WjAPLf NON-ARG 4361 4376 About commerce.
FTVICuxyKq CLAIM-Fact 4486 4541 Sure well, I mean we do a lot of stuff around commerce.
l7n4xixkAR PREMISE-Fact 4542 4676 I mean, we have Facebook Marketplace is probably the most advanced and hundreds of millions of people use that to buy and sell things.
O2G4TTZqsg NON-ARG 4677 4720 Instagram Shopping of course a lot earlier.
UlJyFCRG_t CLAIM-Fact 4849 4932 And then in terms of payments, there's multiple approaches that we're taking there.
-H8eX45zov PREMISE-Fact 4933 4981 We're of course working on payments in WhatsApp.
5jyawn8s62 PREMISE-Fact 4982 5014 We have our test going in India.
j9l5qWITAS PREMISE-Fact 5015 5101 It's the test really shows that a lot of people are going to want to use this product.
0cx6Ay6oHx CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4721 4756 But we're very optimistic about it.
SNKzuTdrr3 CLAIM-Reformulated 4757 4848 But we are optimistic on the timeframe of years, right not driving next quarter's business.
YLX623KuNT CLAIM-Opinion(view) 5102 5239 We're very optimistic that we're going to able to launch to everyone in India soon, but of course will share more news when we have that.
TMCleBQ8PA PREMISE-Fact 5240 5577 And we also differentiate between payment systems that are built on top of the existing financial infrastructure like what we're trying to do with WhatsApp payments or when we make payments in Instagram Shopping, and our work with something like Libra that is trying to build some new technological infrastructure for financial services.
sNWm5aGZfa NON-ARG 6011 6097 It's one of the areas that I am most excited and optimistic about for the years ahead.
4EHHRkygFM NON-ARG 6098 6207 There's a lot to do, which is why we have a lot of different projects that we're trying to push forward here.
GRoEENc9uy NON-ARG 5578 5616 So they're working on different thing.
oXfEMhGAFk NON-ARG 5617 5747 If Libra works, then it will be able to make certain kind of payments whether they're micropayments or remittances across borders.
kkYq1e-SI5 NON-ARG 5748 5859 We'll be able to be done much faster and much more affordably than it can happen today on top of existing rail.
JH0YiFloCe CLAIM-Reformulated 5860 6010 So I remain optimistic that we'll be able to do work there, but we're just working across a lot of different fronts here because this is a huge space.
_YGfOkuATW NON-ARG 6225 6270 Operator, we have time for one last question.
l5fFxJaODd CLAIM-Fact 1785 1823 There were lots of different services.
soQS19Khes CLAIM-Reformulated 2009 2168 So we were competing there with things like Facebook camera, but we ultimately thought that we were going to do better work if we were building with Instagram.
I9xIKkNnzK PREMISE-RealExample 1824 1884 There is a camera plus VSCO Cam, Socialcam, Viddy, Snapseed.
Kw3GgR9FRh PREMISE-RealExample 1885 1916 There were even apps like PAS .
aESTpDT1-R NON-ARG 1917 1949 They were all in the same space.
LLh_NbNcC9 PREMISE-Fact 2169 2354 But if you remember at the time, Instagram was focused on helping people take photos, apply creative filters and share them publicly across different social networks including Facebook.
W1fcSOgt0C NON-ARG 2462 2584 I mean, I remember specifically Kevin and I set a goal that we hope that one day Instagram might reach 100 million people.
wiB9I6IQrO NON-ARG 2585 2656 And I know that that seems quaint today compared to how well it's done.
nFVhRic8hH CLAIM-Fact 2355 2403 It wasn't a full featured social network itself.
6ZtmmHaiJi NON-ARG 2657 2880 But remember that a lot of the other services that were Instagram's peers and were growing quickly at the time including startups with strong teams and very talented founders like Path don't really even exist today anymore.
DXBDXgqgn8 NON-ARG 2881 3032 So look, I mean at the end of the day, the FTC makes its judgment on what we can do, the FTC had all this context when they made this decision in 2012.
kGEv8us_Wf NON-ARG 3033 3125 And the reality is, it ends up being a lot more complementary than I think we ever expected.
4nFWCh_vwg CLAIM-Fact 1298 1524 And at the time of course in some way we considered Instagram to be a competitor, but we've always thought that the better way to target -- to think about Instagram was that it's complementary to Facebook and what we're doing.
tWreEHpED6 PREMISE-Fact 1618 1715 We thought about Instagram in the context of this new mobile camera space that was complementary.
8sPW4Oqck9 NON-ARG 1950 2008 We thought that mobile photos we're going to be important.
jOZ2xKg1eu PREMISE-Fact 1716 1784 If you remember, back then we were building the Facebook camera app.
fCbkwu__gk NON-ARG 1525 1617 Back in 2012, people generally didn't think of Instagram as competing with our core service.
BUlyEpX7nI PREMISE-Statistic 2404 2461 It only had about 30 million people using it at the time.
hf0jwEzMy- NON-ARG 3126 3183 Look, I mean, building services like this is hard, right.
B82O8I8DLw NON-ARG 3184 3333 Instagram wouldn't be what it is today without Kevin and Mike who are just really incredible product leaders and of course did a lot of amazing work.
BSV0K1oiVL NON-ARG 3334 3514 But it also wouldn't be what it is without everything that we put into it and whether that's the infrastructure or our advertising model or spam and safety services and a lot more.
ta2xFm7GZB NON-ARG 3515 3672 And I know it can be really hard given how well things have gone to look back and remember what the world was like at the time that we made this acquisition.
2oXVSqhLaY NON-ARG 3673 3754 But our outlook was really different then and the outcome was not all guaranteed.
sELwxXi4w0 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3755 3897 So look, I mean I think for all the concern about whether there is enough competition, the space today continues to be incredibly competitive.
Ye-qK_OM1G PREMISE-RealExample 3898 4016 We have different competitors in the space today like Snapchat, which shows that people are always building new ideas.
8ilEnAy46- PREMISE-RealExample 4039 4187 Of course remember that both Apple and Google has built cameras and private photo sharing and photo management directly into their operating system.
R9lldDqA6o NON-ARG 4188 4347 So I think that kind of gives you a picture of how we think about some of the scrutiny that's coming and just how we think about doing these things in general.
a6MtR6OCsv PREMISE-Fact 4017 4038 And on mobile phones.
