Lafqz3tkCW NON-ARG 664 692 Keith, it's a good question.
hQBf03s5g5 CLAIM-Reformulated 1639 1893 And so I actually think between those two items, it's the biggest impact that we've seen in the quarter, and I expect to see it again next quarter, given I don't think the macro or IT spend environment should change in any way between these two quarters.
fpd-qKNoNo CLAIM-Fact 795 869 There is clearly a macro impact, especially on the transactional business.
8PgcuJIqzv PREMISE-Fact 870 1028 Transactional businesses tend to be more impacted in emerging markets where we have a higher percentage of non-annuity business that's transactional business.
MsvPre-o3X PREMISE-Fact 1029 1172 Those have been the weakest markets in this macro environment and specifically some of the geos we called out have more exposure in this place.
gQ6RAo_2tg PREMISE-RealExample 1395 1472 If you look at server shipments, you'd say that's actually a macro statement.
o2z1uEetCb PREMISE-Fact 1473 1638 We didn't see it in any one particular workload; it's weakness across workloads, which tends to make more sense frankly with a macro or a budget IT spend constraint.
9s6Tz0y4jH CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1894 1938 So I think less about it being cannibalistic
oWYXghIS34 PREMISE-Fact 1939 2027 because so many of the scenarios in this time period, we've seen the growth we expected.
6qoPgCTGGB PREMISE-Fact 2028 2094 We've seen it across our premium services as well as core compute.
s84zkYfejl PREMISE-Other 2095 2232 I should also say most of the weakness we saw was in the standard workloads, which I think lends itself to again some of those pressures.
e5_QyMQq2c PREMISE-Other 2233 2316 We also saw, and I would expect annuity shifts there, which is the final component.
wAmMLyA_5T PREMISE-Other 2472 2615 And so for me, I do tend to think it's a bit more of the macro pressure and budget impacts than it is frankly any other statement or execution.
24HtDFKraH NON-ARG 693 773 Let me go through a number of factors that really impact transactional business.
gImhx9UKRE NON-ARG 774 794 First, you're right.
TZQOfDryrn PREMISE-Fact 1173 1287 And so you're certainly seeing the macro impact in the intelligent cloud segment and the server weakness is there.
0H7pfW7v2u PREMISE-Fact 1288 1394 And because frankly we saw that macro weakness, you have even seen it in terms of server shipments, right.
TJVp1tXCWm PREMISE-Fact 2317 2393 Our annuity numbers and renewal numbers were very good in Intelligent Cloud.
X1dcVco45q PREMISE-Fact 2394 2471 And in fact, they came right where we expected in terms of unearned balances.
