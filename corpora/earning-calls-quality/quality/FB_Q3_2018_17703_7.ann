cGm93BlOuW NON-ARG 965 982 I can take those.
ajgEJ7AWki CLAIM-Fact 983 1104 When you think about the transition or people using feed versus Stories, there are a couple of things that are different.
fbL5GGHKoH CLAIM-Fact 1105 1128 One is just the format.
Lk_g5JLxZl CLAIM-Fact 1129 1176 And again, we have a lot of experience at this.
LTizI7snww PREMISE-Fact 1177 1277 People had display ads or search ads before they really did Facebook ads, if you look back a decade.
-OEU2xPUeb PREMISE-Fact 1278 1378 And teaching people here is what a Facebook ad looks like was a new format people had to understand.
S51A0oxi3k PREMISE-Fact 1379 1526 Then, as we moved into more photos with Instagram, more videos, a video ad on Facebook or Instagram is a very different thing if they perform well.
MKRlbH8rnA PREMISE-Fact 1527 1591 They need to be natively social than a video ad that runs on TV.
DGN2xTKPjG CLAIM-Fact 1592 1619 So Stories is a new format.
-5hWbRpqrK PREMISE-Fact 1620 1712 It has multiple pictures, multiple screens, words and phrases intermixed in a different way.
luzBANpX6w PREMISE-Fact 1713 1763 And so again, that's a new muscle for advertisers.
gKWOT1AgIN CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1764 1821 I think we're getting people up the curve well this time.
kizcyKwpMT PREMISE-Fact 1822 1948 We've learned that we can't just rely on teaching our clients and teaching the ad agencies to do it, but helping them do that.
Wfx5Z8Uk-w PREMISE-Fact 1949 2119 And so some of the tools we've rolled out that I talked about where we can take your Facebook pictures and your posts and make it a story, that makes that process faster.
Q48DR_8ZAL PREMISE-Fact 2120 2246 I think when you think about the long-term monetization opportunities, it's really going to depend upon the time people spend.
0Aopx2kNzH PREMISE-Fact 2247 2389 The amount of ads we would feel comfortable inserting into a consumer experience really depends upon how many different things you go through.
Nw_UwauYsS PREMISE-Fact 2390 2505 So if you spend more time in Stories, they'll be need to be more engaging because there will be fewer ads in there.
rWp2dMyAdT PREMISE-Fact 2506 2586 Now that may be possible because there's high, high, high engagement in Stories.
k7FcpwgCTw CLAIM-Reformulated 2587 2766 So we're going to have to see the length and how quickly people scroll through them to see how many ad opportunities there are and to see how effective those ad opportunities are.
uQPH6x2C5h PREMISE-Fact 3256 3306 So we think paid messaging, as we've talked about.
ZmR1Z4lSQJ PREMISE-Fact 3307 3435 And WhatsApp is interesting because by virtue of paying, businesses are going to have to be careful about the content they send.
y49I4Tx0L2 PREMISE-Fact 3436 3528 You're not going to send a lot of things people don't want to see if you're paying for them.
p7MR2I9uxp CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3612 3791 The last thing I'll say is that I think these things are more connected than people realize, in the sense that we're already seeing some nice traction with click-to-Messenger ads.
uY7cWOoQfU PREMISE-Fact 3792 3997 So one of the things advertisers are trying to do when they're in feed and ultimately when they're in Stories is drive to transactions and real engagement, one-on-one with a consumer is often part of that.
7FJzpuyEyu PREMISE-Fact 3998 4142 So a click-to-Messenger ad takes advantage of having both of those platforms so that businesses can deepen their relationship with the consumer.
pqTMobosky CLAIM-Fact 2911 3090 When you think about messaging, if we've already made the transition in a big way to feed, if we are starting to see real success in Stories, messaging is in a much earlier stage.
cKjrVg6Ka1 CLAIM-Fact 3091 3255 And what we're doing on Messenger and on WhatsApp are really making sure that businesses can connect with people, and then in the early stages of testing messaging.
HIvdRBomXl CLAIM-Reformulated 3529 3611 And so really focused on the consumer experience there and figuring out over time.
F1xOWHf3Zy CLAIM-Reformulated 4143 4299 And I think those experiences and the interaction between them, we're even in earlier days there, but I think we have a lot of opportunity to explore there.
nAgBTx_Z-n NON-ARG 4317 4341 And, Mark, this is Dave.
DAeeD-91Uv NON-ARG 4342 4366 I just wanted to add in.
JxEgnu5QFK NON-ARG 4367 4451 I think you asked about line of sight on monetization parity on Stories versus feed.
GjHsSvZYL7 NON-ARG 4452 4555 It's obviously hard to say that because they're both dynamic, they're auctions, there's a lot going on.
D_nGRD6jsq CLAIM-Fact 4665 4688 Pricing will take time.
6vgFjhF5Gr PREMISE-Fact 4689 4828 So as we bring more formats to Stories and bring more advertisers to Stories, we can build up that demand and balance that out with supply.
i4eEgooZVa CLAIM-Reformulated 4829 4963 But I think in terms of it converging on feed from any pricing perspective, that's a journey that's going to take years, not quarters.
A4_Kw3e8NZ CLAIM-Reformulated 4964 4991 So it's going to take time.
HzZjs3QQll CLAIM-Fact 4556 4664 But I would say that at least in the near term, the impression growth opportunity is significant on Stories.
-rxsH5NNd6 CLAIM-Fact 2767 2910 Our business depends upon the amount of ads that we can share and the effectiveness of those ads, which drives up ROI and ultimately the price.
