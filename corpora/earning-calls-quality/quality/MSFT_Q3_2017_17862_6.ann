ip1AlLc86I NON-ARG 995 1000 Yeah.
gggkigXc4t CLAIM-Fact 1001 1113 The timeframes of these migrations and so on are a lot more complicated than they perhaps appear on the surface.
d_hvpgroVI PREMISE-Other 1114 1141 So here's what we think of.
JMKz4k99qa PREMISE-RealExample 1142 1253 For example, right when everyone's talking about the cloud, the most interesting part is the edge of the cloud.
PuhOI_MC3c PREMISE-RealExample 1254 1518 Whether it's IoT, whether it's the auto industry, whether it's what's happening in retail, essentially compute is going where the data gets generated, and increasingly data is getting generated at the volumes in which it's drawing compute to it, which is the edge.
2GynqGKeit PREMISE-Fact 1519 1637 So if you look even at our announcements over this quarter, a lot of what we have done with IoT is create an IoT edge.
i-VCsHQJ3i PREMISE-Other 1638 1815 Of course, we have an amazing cloud with the SaaS services for IoT, but the edge compute, the ability to run a neural network at the edge, do inferences at the edge is exciting.
gM4DKSb3hX CLAIM-Fact 1816 1921 Azure Stack is going to completely change what hybrid is and the expectations customers have with hybrid.
GEU_ezzchV PREMISE-RealExample 1922 1958 I mean, GEICO example is a good one.
-JYllbH01y PREMISE-RealExample 1959 2057 What's happening with SQL Server, SQL Server is no longer just about a database that's on-premise.
x58cWaTYRk PREMISE-Fact 2058 2126 It's a database that's on-premise that can be tiered with the cloud.
W008_Ze7Ko PREMISE-Fact 2127 2171 A single table can be extended to the cloud.
hoqk88hDW2 PREMISE-Fact 2172 2218 The queries will work across both the tiering.
9nH2FAO_5b CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2219 2375 And so to me, the innovative work we're doing is what I would characterize as the future of true distributed computing, which is it will remain distributed.
sPUX1InT4P CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2376 2416 And that's what we are building towards.
HSQMRF_NOL CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2417 2518 We'll talk a lot more and build on that about that architecture and what we're seeing with customers.
xcDfzymTWE CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2519 2695 Then given that what you are saying is true, which is there will be some which will be lift and shift of workloads, but then there is lift, shift, and modernizing of workloads.
HluTg1sNV8 PREMISE-Fact 2696 2862 And in that modernizing phase, it's not just being modernized to live only in what is called a cloud, but it will also be modernized to live in the edge of the cloud.
kx8Ro6mBRN CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2863 2904 And so that's the transformation at play.
KtSdZ7XQsG PREMISE-Fact 2905 2958 That's a multiyear and a generational transformation.
L1_mALZt-w PREMISE-Fact 2959 3017 Quarter to quarter, there will be all kinds of volatility.
E_nMVxhBFS CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3018 3183 But what is clear to me and clear to Microsoft's engineers is that we have a very clear world view of what is it that we want to get done, and we stay focused on it.
WjlVkP3iqg CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3197 3366 And I think, Karl, to your question about how that shows up, it's why you hear us focus more on the all-up KPI between Azure and this transactional or on-premise number,
jG4vsFd8qG PREMISE-Fact 3367 3492 because the line between them, both strategically and literally, is more important to be blurred and going in that direction.
gjpcBK2x0W CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3493 3580 And so this quarter, you saw a little bit healthier than we had thought, I pointed out.
edHq0s-Px1 PREMISE-Fact 3581 3642 It tends to be â€“ in this instance, Japan was a little better.
XwF287wGDs PREMISE-Other 3643 3676 It can be product-launch related.
kke1N7u2U7 PREMISE-Other 3677 3702 It can be macro-impacted.
0_l9RLeTjt CLAIM-Reformulated 3703 4008 But whether or not you see that in transactional, the Uber trend of being able to see it through the all-up KPI, the dynamic Satya has talked about, you're going to hear us talk more and more about, whether it's a quote-unquote, on-prem server launch or an Azure feature, about the integration of the two.
VElIkKWAeH NON-ARG 4058 4075  Thank you, Karl.
VhwqxqAIMI NON-ARG 4076 4114 We'll go to the next question, please.
