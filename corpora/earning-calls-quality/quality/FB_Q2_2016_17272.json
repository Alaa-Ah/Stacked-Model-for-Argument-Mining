Like you said, we're not specifically breaking out revenue numbers.

And so that is going to make it smaller in how it's going to appear in the revenue numbers. The overall growth is still being driven predominantly by Facebook. Instagram is clearly making a contribution and as is the Audience Network. In terms of ad load, as I said, it's been one of the factors driving supply, so it certainly has been helpful.

And we continue to feel that there are opportunities to execute on those and to continue to grow inventory in that way. So that's where we would focus.
