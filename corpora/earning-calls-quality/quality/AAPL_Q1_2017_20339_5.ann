Vt_k0oBjU1 NON-ARG 354 359 Sure.
7_wGoERsBC PREMISE-Statistic 425 485 We had guided 38% to 38.5%, and we came in at 38.5% exactly.
Z9rwPk1Yvw PREMISE-Fact 486 699 And really, the slight improvement over the midpoint of the guidance range was due to the fact that our revenue was ahead of our expectations, and so we got a bit more leverage out of the increased revenue levels.
HamuYrn9j- CLAIM-Opinion(view) 700 758 We felt very good about the gross margins for the quarter.
QaAchco7w9 PREMISE-Fact 759 827 Again, keep in mind the strong dollar doesn't help us on that front.
kGVsRAEkVd PREMISE-Fact 360 424 We were actually at the high end of the range for gross margins.
YVcTgqBH2_ NON-ARG 1046 1076 That's a really good question.
i5wZ6qkXsl CLAIM-Fact 1231 1267 and so we were very happy about that
9wZPWQ3nJ- PREMISE-Fact 1077 1230 Despite the demonetization move in India that created lots of economic pressure there last quarter, despite that, we had all-time record revenue results,
IZZjBqEu3U PREMISE-Fact 1269 1330 The demonetization impact has not worked its way through yet.
iVKOwlrUbg PREMISE-Fact 1331 1374 It's still definitely having some overhang.
u_1QB_PXpf CLAIM-Reformulated 1375 1477 But I think in the longer term, it's a great move, and I feel really good about how we're doing there.
cRB2XWkGOc CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1478 1641 We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it's a great place to be.
