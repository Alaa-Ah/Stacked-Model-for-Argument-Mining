krba5LIyce NON-ARG 1088 1142 Heather, I'll take the first question regarding CapEx.
0vt6wBLXN_ CLAIM-Fact 1143 1264 So, yeah, we are investing ahead of user growth, given the long lead time in deploying data centers and network capacity.
b-wx86giyf PREMISE-Fact 1265 1327 So we are building some capacity ahead of our immediate needs.
aZZZyR4YUY NON-ARG 1328 1355 So that is playing into it.
Wcyva0Axia PREMISE-Fact 1356 1433 But we're also making investments to support the core growth of the business.
X2nygVvPwv CLAIM-Fact 1434 1518 There's a lot of compute that goes behind, things like feed ranking and ads ranking.
LurkHKqSbv PREMISE-Other 1519 1661 We think there is good ROI to putting more servers behind things like choosing the right ad for the right impression opportunity that we have.
aLr5FA2eIP CLAIM-Reformulated 1662 1705 So we are putting more compute behind that.
sMDIpkB_YS PREMISE-RealExample 1706 1866 And then, I'd also make the comment that a lot of our growth is coming from markets in Asia, our top growth countries were India, Indonesia and the Philippines.
wyl6EqyKLN CLAIM-Reformulated 2003 2131 So we're continuing to invest and we're seeing increased CapEx in 2019, albeit at a much slower growth rate than we had in 2018.
XREIYnUjv5 PREMISE-Fact 1867 1955 So we're building capacity to serve that Asian peak and those users are at a lower ARPU.
Fmcu1j_7lq CLAIM-Fact 1956 2002 So that impacts the overall capital intensity.
4aJnW1uBcR NON-ARG 2154 2231 I'll talk about Stories and I'll share a fun and, I think, important example.
gN8MzfMKGw CLAIM-Fact 2232 2339 We know that when people are using more of the opportunities to reach consumers, their returns often go up.
VHWLhNY5Hz PREMISE-RealExample 2340 2383 So the fun example is the Furbo Dog Camera.
NcFWeM7bZn PREMISE-RealExample 2413 2540 They built this camera where you can see/talk and you can see and talk and toss dog treats to your dog when you're not at home.
RgItWtHuRK PREMISE-RealExample 2541 2744 They ran a video ad campaign across Facebook and Instagram Stories and they targeted people with dog-related interests and used Custom Audiences to exclude people who had already purchased their product.
Q9MGoZyF7M PREMISE-RealExample 2745 2862 By running across Facebook Stories and Instagram Stories, they drove 20% more leads than our other digital campaigns.
lHmqhskKmB CLAIM-Reformulated 2863 3021 So anecdotally, with our early, early adopters, we can see that we believe the increased opportunities here really work, and we have other examples like this.
PH7h-rO0-J NON-ARG 3022 3081 In terms of how early it is for adoption, it's super early.
jVbu-w0RJr NON-ARG 3082 3198 We just rolled out the ability to do this in August, and we have to drive awareness and drive people into trying it.
f0ua2ruuUG PREMISE-Fact 3199 3443 And even when we make it super easy for people to get their ads into the right format, from the smallest mom-and-pop to the largest brands, people want to understand the creative of their ad and it needs to be in a format they feel comfortable.
V0XkfBdXU3 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3444 3535 So as more people use Stories, we think they will increasingly feel comfortable in Stories.
Mkja-HlNkF NON-ARG 3536 3638 But we have a long road ahead of us even with tools that make it easy to drive awareness and adoption.
mdSQaLClYP CLAIM-Reformulated 3639 3685 We think once we do, the returns will be good.
0Ue2HxkI4b NON-ARG 2384 2412 They're a Taiwanese company.
PllQflTJkG NON-ARG 3703 3753  Operator, we are going to take one last question.
