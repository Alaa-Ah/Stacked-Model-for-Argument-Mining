pXAdLDZIOp NON-ARG 3621 3641 There's a lot there.
MNctOSxdEi NON-ARG 3642 3736 Let me just say I don't recall saying the things that you said I said about the upgrade cycle.
TbewbAirZX NON-ARG 3737 3768 Let me get that out of the way.
zrkIsckqLl NON-ARG 3769 3818 Now let me describe without the specific numbers.
zWJu913rOF CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4294 4405 Now the good news is â€“ the great news from my point of view is I think we're strategically positioned very well
2M_mLY3F9e PREMISE-Fact 4406 4444 because we've announced the iPhone SE.
vp0-sruXM2 PREMISE-Fact 4445 4507 We are attracting customers that we previously didn't attract.
-KCg4YiTR9 PREMISE-Statistic 4584 4641 And the installed base is up 80% over the last two years.
tyJmKtBLPg NON-ARG 1378 1393 Toni, it's Tim.
ToMwjbKFuy NON-ARG 1394 1436 Let me see if I can address your question.
MoXspNw53n CLAIM-Reformulated 2634 2725 But I think iPhone has a particularly different kind of cycle to it than the tablet market.
rFhAXCQsGe NON-ARG 2384 2439 We continue to be very optimistic on the iPad business.
RQwTQbTFNg NON-ARG 2440 2587 And as I had said in my remarks, we believe we're going to have the best compare for iPad revenue this quarter that we have had in quite some time.
WJkSpMoPJG NON-ARG 2588 2633 And so we'll report back in July on that one.
qvWXhxwu_F CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1911 2083 I think that the tablet market in general, one of the challenges with the tablet market is that the replacement cycle is materially different than in the smartphone market.
fBvkLvzNZN PREMISE-Fact 2279 2383 But the consumer behavior there is you tend to hold on for a very long period of time before an upgrade.
qsMTwQmHjs NON-ARG 2084 2174 And so as you probably know, we haven't had an issue in customer satisfaction on the iPad.
edYaHfoLga NON-ARG 2175 2196 It's incredibly high.
zILdrgfMgF NON-ARG 2197 2248 And we haven't had an issue with usage of the iPad.
ralXvgNsad NON-ARG 2249 2278 The usage is incredibly high.
iZoxEsXPsD NON-ARG 1822 1870 And so do I think it will be like the iPad mini?
VPffeOMUAM NON-ARG 1871 1892 No, I don't think so.
EFaIwwJcbR NON-ARG 1893 1910 I don't see that.
eNMR0ZqEeZ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1759 1821 And so that is really why we have the constraint that we have.
g8LV25o2bQ PREMISE-Fact 1684 1758 It is clear that there is a demand there even much beyond what we thought.
ndstfJItIg PREMISE-Fact 1612 1683 The iPhone SE, we are thrilled with the response that we've seen on it.
gBQdkLvx1P NON-ARG 1437 1611 The channel inventory reduction that Luca referred to, the vast, vast majority of that is in iPhone, and so that would affect the unit compare that you may be thinking about.
6Uvq_TQPLo PREMISE-Other 4508 4527 That's really great
ni2SIaOTbl CLAIM-Reformulated 4642 4680 And so all of those I think bode well.
VzEMOcXkoK NON-ARG 4681 4809 And the switcher comments I made earlier, I wouldn't underestimate that because that's very important for us in every geography.
ibdAVPLslT NON-ARG 4810 4837 So thanks for the question.
iHi0I9XMuA CLAIM-Other 4121 4262 And so without giving you exact numbers, if we would have the same rate on iPhone 6s that we did iPhone 6, it would be time for a huge party.
GbwGnc6hxC CLAIM-Reformulated 4263 4293 It would be a huge difference.
3Opz3kgC04 PREMISE-Other 4529 4583 And this tough compare eventually isn't the benchmark.
gs7f8KNctL PREMISE-Fact 3819 4070 The iPhone 6s upgrade cycle that we've measured for the first half of this year, so the first six months of our fiscal year to be precise, is slightly better than the rate that we saw with the iPhone 5s two years ago, but it's lower than the iPhone 6.
Abbt3v2tfU NON-ARG 4071 4102 I don't mean just a hair lower.
KQGSkdTTHJ PREMISE-Fact 4103 4120 It's a lot lower.
