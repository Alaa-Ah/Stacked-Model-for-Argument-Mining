S49OfYkcWS CLAIM-Opinion(view) 842 1050 In ads in Stories, we rolled out globally about 1.5 years after launching Instagram so it's still early but we're definitely seeing a lot of value for businesses on Instagram, and we believe same on Facebook.
a6E1FUC2T8 PREMISE-RealExample 1051 1184 To share one example, a local e-commerce jewelry brand called Lokai started donating 10% of their net profits to charitable partners.

et8oWpGwEX CLAIM-Reformulated 1346 1479 So I think we are seeing that – including on Facebook, including in ads even though it's earlier – the additional opportunity is big.

TmlCEjIGzW NON-ARG 1781 1933 And there's some opportunity to increase – we were seeing increased engagement in Stories and there's some opportunity to increase load growing forward.
FadTp58fDi PREMISE-Fact 1934 2169 On Instagram Feed, which was the second factor, we have seen some increase in ad load on Instagram on a year-over-year basis, but we expect that there'll be less significant growth opportunities going forward on Instagram Feed ad load.
-ge6T4ZfES PREMISE-Fact 2170 2302 And then finally, you've got – you have Facebook Feed which we're still seeing impression growth and that's coming around the globe.
qzNK1sPS7G NON-ARG 2303 2368 And we're tending to see growth in – outside the U.S. and Canada.
