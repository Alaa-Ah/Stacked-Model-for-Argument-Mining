GDZydw0ljm NON-ARG 952 971 Yeah, thanks, Mark.
QJGqCbkpFg CLAIM-Fact 972 1039 Like you said, we're not specifically breaking out revenue numbers.
eT7Ox1E89N PREMISE-Fact 1040 1260 One thing to just keep in mind is Instagram is known and operated property is represented gross in our revenue, so whereas as I mentioned the Audience Network is by and large going to be recognized net rather than gross.
xQGeXr-dUA CLAIM-Fact 1261 1352 And so that is going to make it smaller in how it's going to appear in the revenue numbers.
EJL6goTTU3 PREMISE-Fact 1353 1420 The overall growth is still being driven predominantly by Facebook.
olon_b0y-v PREMISE-Fact 1421 1495 Instagram is clearly making a contribution and as is the Audience Network.
mJlxcjRquW PREMISE-Fact 1607 1690 But there's also DAU growth and time spent per DAU growth so time spent per person.
Paz5uHRGTu CLAIM-Fact 1691 1810 And we continue to feel that there are opportunities to execute on those and to continue to grow inventory in that way.
Wk4W6EYZk_ CLAIM-Reformulated 1811 1842 So that's where we would focus.
9y9upQZHuK PREMISE-Fact 1843 1993 You know, as we drive DAU faster than MAU, then that's going to increase that ratio, but we're really focused on driving DAU and time spent per person
bF0vL2yLhx PREMISE-Fact 1496 1572 In terms of ad load, as I said, it's been one of the factors driving supply,
dCpL6kpkdF CLAIM-Fact 1573 1606 so it certainly has been helpful.
kzQVIQdcQV NON-ARG 2012 2019  Great.
