MCj_jMCeem NON-ARG 937 942 Sure.
RyYOvmcDeR NON-ARG 943 1002 Let me start with the retail subscription services revenue.
MzRGXCYMHT NON-ARG 1002 1047  So there's multiple things in that category.
szCDWshCuf NON-ARG 1048 1211 The largest is Prime membership fees, but also other subscription services like audio books, eBooks, digital video, digital music, and other subscription services.
abZnZzLTiI NON-ARG 1212 1330 So you're right, there was an acceleration, much like the comment I had on advertising and the other revenue category.
OisHeuVAtz NON-ARG 1331 1415 The Prime membership growth rates for Q1 and Q4 last year are relatively consistent.
NxCUxjwfta NON-ARG 1416 1458 So the volatility is in these other items.
bJUtiJIOdT NON-ARG 1459 1616 So I'm not quantifying the Prime membership or commenting on the growth rates, other than to say it's been very strong and Q4 strength has continued into Q1.
vVQvKzAydV NON-ARG 1617 1954 Your comment on shipping costs, yeah, that is going to – it was lower unit volume as well, but generally, costs are going to be a combination of the tail – the headwinds are obviously going to be FBA growth and shipping more products ourselves and this expansion of our Prime program and the demand for products from our Prime customers.
XFCBwaIRPd NON-ARG 1955 1985 And the demand has been great.
xsuFESamME NON-ARG 1986 2127 Again, there's over 50 million items that people can get delivered to their doorstep within two days or, in some cases, next day or same day.
OmjMdGYtxx NON-ARG 2128 2300 So it's going to be a big part of our cost structure but it's an investment we work hard to reduce as far as rates, and we're glad to spend it to support our Prime program.
