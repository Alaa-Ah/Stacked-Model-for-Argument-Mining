0Lv49FmH1j NON-ARG 472 536 I would really just point to the overall dynamics of the system.
KHOZQhw7-W CLAIM-Fact 1749 1820 In terms of the supply side, obviously News Feed is incredibly valuable
gpYyFPVEJn PREMISE-Fact 1821 1864 because it's very present for the consumer.
5JZpjm7ZBr PREMISE-Fact 1865 1968 And we've improved the quality of the ads in News Feed, and that's another driver from the supply side.
SVUbNAYQVu NON-ARG 537 639 And again, what we're seeing is with slower supply growth, that's going to play out to higher pricing.
3Yo9LYwdtL NON-ARG 640 668 And again, are we effective?
4RaZaUKgk4 NON-ARG 669 850 And we've been effective at delivering good return on investment for our advertisers and getting better at converting what we have as inventory into what they care about as outcomes
KqWVvxJxI7 NON-ARG 852 923 And that from a systemic point of view is what's playing through there.
Lygne2qJlz CLAIM-Fact 924 1036 From a product perspective, as we get things like Dynamic Product Ads rolled out, those are incredibly valuable.
6AXF6LQX8r PREMISE-Fact 1037 1300 As we connect more advertisers with those and bring more data into the system and we can get more of the impressions that are very highly targeted and very relevant, then we'll be rewarded with better pricing as we can expand that out into things like Lookalikes.
LUPgX1Seza NON-ARG 1301 1342 We've talked a lot about it on this call.
GKPUhbV6qf PREMISE-Fact 1343 1579 That basically takes some of that really good targeting and extends that into a much bigger audience, and then we can get more impressions at better value because we're really connecting that with end results that the advertisers value.
XV9gB3ZIGj NON-ARG 1580 1748 So it's really all that type of work that we do to get the system better and better, and so we're constantly working to get better penetration of these key ad products.
