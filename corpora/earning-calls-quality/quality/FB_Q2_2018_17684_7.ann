DD4t7fi5X8 NON-ARG 790 803 I'll take it.
7X1tPFOtUX CLAIM-Fact 804 915 So, obviously, we started with ads in Facebook, and that was something we have grown and they continue to grow.
IQkpvrnFku CLAIM-Opinion(view) 916 1063 The ads have expanded quite nicely to Instagram, and Instagram represents a very healthy part of the growth and we expect that to continue as well.
dSqTssnk7K NON-ARG 1064 1170 When you think about things that are further out, I think you then start talking about our messaging apps.
tYiH0cW1iy CLAIM-Fact 1171 1238 We are furthest ahead in Messenger, but it's still very early days.
6SaSeM2Z-u NON-ARG 1561 1616 We're being very slow and deliberate with monetization.
GonFubIL4- CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1643 1758 But I think we've launched some things that people are excited about and interested in like click-to-Messenger ads.
0a-nk9zd4l PREMISE-Fact 1759 1822 We also have some early nice results we can share from clients.

qrqStYvOjI PREMISE-Fact 1854 2039 They launched a Messenger bot to help with gift recommendations, and they created a click-to-Messenger ads that link to a LEGO bot which helped provide product and gift recommendations.
sxMutljbLp PREMISE-Statistic 2040 2311 They reached people over 25 years old in the U.S., UK, France and Germany, and targeted people who are interested in LEGO toys and shopping, and they found a 3.4 times higher return on ad spend for click-to-Messenger ads versus those that just linked to the LEGO website.
1eyOWgCRO1 CLAIM-Reformulated 2312 2376 And I share that case because it shows what we're excited about.
sB8EcHqxdq CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2377 2493 We're excited about a new surface where businesses can interact with consumers, but also really a new functionality.
4bAVXRCJC- PREMISE-Fact 2494 2562 If you go further out, you would then start thinking about WhatsApp.
EWlguvNbbS PREMISE-Fact 2563 2690 We are very focused there on the user experience, but we're also focused even earlier stages on growing our business ecosystem.
