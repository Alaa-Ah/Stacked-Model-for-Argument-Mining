R7kjmDdDhT CLAIM-Fact 800 829 And there's volatility to it.
uy_tX_r64O CLAIM-Opinion(view) 830 1025 So the way to think about it is over the year, it's up a little and in Q2, it happens to be just a low quarter of the 12 that come up through the cycle, much like Q4 was quite large in the cycle.
YDzd3AU1lw CLAIM-Fact 1026 1072 And Azure actually falls a couple of patterns.
r8FEy9XMhy PREMISE-Fact 1153 1457 Because it tends to be project-based as well and many of the investments we've made in sales capacity, and the reason we did some of the sales transformation, was to invest a lot more in that project-led motion, which is a bit disconnected actually from the EA renewal cycle, and you've really seen that.
_RGffZivRr CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1458 1616 The Azure pace is not, if you drew a line, as correlated to EAs as it even was 3 years ago, as we've I think matured the product and matured our sales cycles.
QTztjDuqCI CLAIM-Fact 1073 1152 It's not just about EA attach although it absolutely can be one of the motions.
