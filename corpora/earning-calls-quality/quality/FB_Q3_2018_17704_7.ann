ziw1UTJ2W1 PREMISE-Fact 2861 2945 There are going to be things that our systems miss, no matter how well-tuned we are.
We75hO9exS CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2946 2980 But I think we're making progress.
cshBMcPTeP PREMISE-Fact 2981 3057 We've made a lot of progress in the last couple of years on content overall.
