DcviIERD6W NON-ARG 498 502 Yes.
Z18csv1B73 NON-ARG 503 593 I know there's been a lot of speculation around the topic of different moves and so forth.
HGSmXafS2Z NON-ARG 594 650 I wouldn't put a lot of stock into those, if I were you.

ku_q2gEhaS PREMISE-RealExample 738 893 There's a significant level of content from the United States and a lot from Japan to Korea to China and the European Union also contributes a fair amount.
zHpvzDBTKp CLAIM-Opinion(view) 946 1009 Largely, I think that will carry the day in the future as well.
jOc6g3x7Zl CLAIM-Fact 1009 1111 In terms of the exclusions, we've been making the Mac Pro in the U.S., we want to continue doing that.
9DmNfo1NN8 CLAIM-Fact 1112 1219 And so, we're working and investing currently in capacity to do so, because we want to continue to be here.
T8a0s_y6NM NON-ARG 1220 1263 And so that's what's behind the exclusions.
lLi5RvBy7S NON-ARG 1264 1326 And so, we're explaining that and hope for a positive outcome.

KODQnRRWx9 NON-ARG 1855 1899 But, I think I can give you some color here.
Z_pW-wYy1w CLAIM-Fact 1900 1998 You know that in general, we decrease our inventory during the March quarter and the June quarter.
xsDytQbuSL CLAIM-Reformulated 1999 2043 That has been traditionally what we've done.
7puBSn1PK7 CLAIM-Fact 2044 2190 This year, we reduced channel inventory for iPhone slightly more than last year and that is true in total and it's true for Greater China as well.
Ua6GNaVp6s CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2191 2285 So, we feel very good about our channel inventory ranges as we get into the September quarter.
KJeV0JTEZj NON-ARG 2286 2316 Hope that helps you with that.
