bP9L8mWI6j PREMISE-Statistic 856 1003 So I would say the biggest impact in the margin that you're seeing in Q2 is really around the 71% increase in assets acquired under capital leases.

OTv2JkRmhj CLAIM-Fact 667 855 Those margins, as we say frequently, are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and always going to be a net of investments, excuse me, price reductions and cost efficiencies that we drive.
