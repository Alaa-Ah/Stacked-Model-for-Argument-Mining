8LHa8_s1UQ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1173 1364 Well, I think the answer to that is we don't know all the answers around what kinds of content are going to work and are not, so we will probably experiment with a number of different things.
A19LEywfcJ NON-ARG 1365 1488 I do think your point is right that not all kinds of content can be supported by ads, no matter how effective we make that.
zplPlgkRzF CLAIM-Fact 1621 1776 And what we would like to transition that more to over time and what an increasing amount of the content is, is revenue shares for ads shown in the videos.

Q63nnaB7zY PREMISE-RealExample 1967 2369 And we've certainly found on the Internet and YouTube and in other places that there are whole industries around creators with different cost structures than traditional Hollywood folks who can produce very informative and engaging content that a lot of people like and enjoy and that builds communities and that helps people connect together in a way that definitely can be supported by this ad model.
xRz8JxXC-d CLAIM-Reformulated 2370 2432 So I think the answer is we're going to try a bunch of things.
VB5yjMsLeA NON-ARG 2433 2470 That's a bunch of what the budget is.
cRSUWceVmQ CLAIM-Reformulated 2471 2650 I'm very optimistic that a lot of this stuff will be able to be supported long term, but you're certainly right that not all of it will be able to be supported by ad models alone.
NMPQozBH4y PREMISE-Fact 1489 1620 That said, the current model that we have for at least getting some of the lighthouse content onto the platform is to pay up front.
