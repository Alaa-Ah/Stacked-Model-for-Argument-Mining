One for you, Amy, and one for you, Satya. One, Amy, when I look at your comments on gross margin, clearly you're not in a position to break out Azure-only gross margin.

So if I take what I believe could be a rough split between Azure versus the SaaS segment and look at the best-of-breed companies, I could get about 70% \u2013 75% gross margin when you hit your targets.
