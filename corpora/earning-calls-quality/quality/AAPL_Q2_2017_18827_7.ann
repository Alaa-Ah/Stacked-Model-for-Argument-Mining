8LYY6eqXXT NON-ARG 3478 3513 There are a lot of questions there.
86AR6N_mrp NON-ARG 3514 3553 Let me give you some color as I see it.
0XZ_Rt6sCC PREMISE-Statistic 3554 3621 In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units.
hdq1TRTCHQ PREMISE-Fact 4142 4319 In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders ever in any six-month period in the first half of this year, first half of this fiscal year to be precise.
F3sJNG87Op PREMISE-Fact 4320 4437 And we saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen.
uTZ3xIMlJL CLAIM-Fact 4438 4552 And so in four of the five operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth.
orKCchAaTP NON-ARG 4665 4761 And so that's kind of the color I would add there, and hopefully some of that is useful for you.
FS07ibUMwH CLAIM-Fact 4553 4664 And it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which is growing incredibly fast around the world.
FBR24WaWAy CLAIM-Fact 3622 3832 And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis.
p6aSg6QEOx NON-ARG 3833 4004 Last quarter, I'm sure other folks remember, was a 14-week quarter, and so you have to adjust the rates last quarter to get at what the underlying sell-through growth was.
s5HKNN12IU NON-ARG 4005 4141 And so I think that when you do that, you're going to find that actually the year-over-year performance is similar between the quarters.
5euBv6QixR NON-ARG 4776 4792 Thank you, Toni.
joS5kJNmQC NON-ARG 4793 4833 Could we have the next question, please?
QJNCoMPoZ2 NON-ARG 908 972 FRAND stands for fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms.
I2SQKJSngm NON-ARG 973 1018 That's both the price and the business terms.
esVZp-oUfd CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1065 1174 And so I don't believe that a – I don't believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that.
0DvkNaILdI PREMISE-Other 1175 1253 I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see.
dKFbOmTzyS PREMISE-Fact 1019 1064 Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple.
FcQUU6oBTj PREMISE-Fact 1364 1395 You don't know how much to pay.
H4FKY09TZl CLAIM-Policy 1522 1578 And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that.
zy--wBPQiO CLAIM-Reformulated 1579 1704 Unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount, but right now we're depending upon the courts to do that.
TbBejKu4x8 NON-ARG 1705 1733 And so that is the thinking.
BCQEPMxHWj PREMISE-Other 1396 1521 And so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, and there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there.
flWpSDnA60 PREMISE-Fact 764 907 Anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what are called FRAND terms.
itnJLyvUY7 PREMISE-RealExample 1969 2084 It's not – it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done.
miokTqKNpp CLAIM-Fact 1734 1851 The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value.
Yln226TvLm CLAIM-Fact 1852 1968 And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is.
u6M8NSIIsF NON-ARG 2085 2166 And so we don't think that's right, and so we're taking a principled stand on it.
6E2Q80cjMQ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2167 2251 And we strongly believe we're in the right, and I'm sure they believe that they are.
FFv7asGqJs NON-ARG 2252 2283 And that's what courts are for.
kVh5RP4kT- NON-ARG 2284 2317 And so we'll let it go with that.
E1k4KuIpj3 PREMISE-Fact 1254 1363 In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount.
