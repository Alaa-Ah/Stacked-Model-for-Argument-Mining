I would say we're going to continue to invest in core product development and infrastructure. And so, you've seen that already in terms of the ramp that we have in capital expenditures. We're continuing to build out features and functionality for the community across a wide range of different products, whether it be the ad products that Sheryl talked about or IGTV and the like. In addition to those core developments, we're also making the significant long-term investments in safety and security. Those investments are in the billions of dollars per year.
