Let me start with your first question. So as you point out, we've had Amazon Logistics deliveries in the UK for more years than some of our other countries and what we see is it gives us control of the shipment for a lot longer. We can, again, shift order cutoff times out and time is valuable to us because, again, we can avoid split shipments, we can avoid other costs of acceleration. And so having control later in the process is very valuable to us especially as we're working across multiple nodes in a network. But I've driven with drivers in Downtown London and it's a very interesting experience. I think it's a great value to our customers. It's interesting to see the route density that we see in the high cities \u2013 or, excuse me, in some cities and the challenges and the upside of that. But I would say essentially, in a nutshell, our logistics deliveries allow us to have better control of the end delivery in markets where we use it. The challenge is always going to be cost and as we get better at this and get economies of scale, we lower those costs over time. So that's essentially my overview of Amazon Logistics. Sorry, your second question was on \u2013 oh, the stores, sorry. Yes, you probably noticed we launched the \u2013 we opened the Amazon Go Store in Seattle in the fourth quarter. We think that is very interesting. It's only one store at this time. But it's using some of the same technologies you would see in self-driving cars; computer vision, sensor, fusion, deep learning. So it's a great accomplishment by that team. It's in beta right now and we like the promise of that. Probably more advanced and further along are the Amazon Bookstores. We have three physical stores; Seattle, San Diego, and Portland right now. We see adding five more this year. So we're still in that phase where we're testing and learning and getting better, even on the bookstore. I would say there's other things that are physical in nature, the pop-up stores and college pickup points that we learn from as well, and think creates a great value particularly at the college pickup points. So not much projection beyond where we are today except for the fact that we will be adding more bookstores. But we test, we innovate, we think the bookstores for instance are a really great way for customers to engage with our devices and see them, touch them, play with them and become fans. So we see a lot of value in that as well.", "start": 723, "labels": ["ANSWER"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": true, "created_at": "2022-02-04T10:03:51.612370Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-04T10:03:51.612375Z", "lead_time": null, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "task": 17419, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null}], "data": {"year": 2016, "company": "AMZN", "my_text": "\nOperator: Thank you.
