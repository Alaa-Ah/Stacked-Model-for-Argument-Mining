g3IDctmsyL PREMISE-Fact 814 899 In terms of CNB, that's the reference I made in my comments to the lower expiry base.
RKfz2Kp0sj PREMISE-Fact 1070 1177 So the fact that we were able to grow in that low expiry base is actually very good structural performance.
Cz24t6awd5 NON-ARG 606 611 Sure.
6leYus4yql CLAIM-Opinion(view) 612 813 Strong unearned in particular was actually better than expected Azure billings in the quarter that drove unearned above the high end of our guide, and I think we were quite pleased by that performance.
hqIKw4SE6l PREMISE-Fact 900 990 Quarter to quarter and year to year, we just have different amounts of contracts expiring.
uImdgoabF6 PREMISE-Fact 991 1069 And so this was one of our lower contract bases and was lower than a year ago.
McJzrwunyQ NON-ARG 1188 1207  Thank you, Walter.
