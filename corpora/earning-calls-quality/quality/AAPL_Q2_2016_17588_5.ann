mdo-LTQfF6 PREMISE-RealExample 1111 1302 And particularly when you look at iPhone, what I was mentioning to Gene earlier, I think we've got a couple of things that are affecting not only ASPs, but obviously they also affect margins.
5AMB9UNwWC PREMISE-Fact 1303 1472 And it's the fact that we had a channel inventory reduction at the top end of the range, and we've got the introduction of the iPhone SE at the entry level of the range.
NOpXthLQUv CLAIM-Reformulated 1473 1589 And so when you take into account those factors, those are the big elements that drive our guidance range right now.
BlySOLRz6K CLAIM-Opinion(view) 645 748 clearly the commodity environment remains quite favorable, and we continue to expect cost improvements.
W8Hcl9JiWq NON-ARG 2164 2284 Katy, in the short term, let me just make a couple of comments on the developed markets just to make sure this is clear.
wcGuLn1s10 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2690 2840 And so the nut of the idea is that I think there's still really, really good business in the developed markets, so I wouldn't want to write those off.
gI3v0bbLeM CLAIM-Reformulated 2966 3059 With our worldwide share, there's still quite a bit of room in the developed markets as well.
7vXKQAdvjo NON-ARG 2841 2965 And it's our jobs to come up with great products that people desire, and also to continue to attract over Android switchers.
sRk21zGpsp PREMISE-Statistic 2285 2379 If you look at our installed base of iPhone today versus two years ago, it's increased by 80%.
gukxRoMY1g NON-ARG 3958 4204 We've been working in India now for a couple of years or more, but we've been working with great energy over the last 18 months or so, and I'm encouraged by the results that we're beginning to see there, and believe there's a lot, lot more there.
wDwOXn0tdW CLAIM-Opinion(view) 4435 4578 But I view India as where China was maybe seven to ten years ago from that point of view, and I think there's a really great opportunity there.
KQH0Nc_afr PREMISE-Fact 4205 4268 It is already the third largest smartphone market in the world.
8AQ2LqPROx PREMISE-Fact 4269 4434 But because the smartphones that are working there are low end, primarily because of the network and the economics, the market potential has not been as great there.
OFWRtrQ8ZJ PREMISE-Other 3060 3303 And from an India point of view, if you look at India, and each country has a different story a bit, but the things that have held not only us back perhaps but some others as well is that the LTE rollout with India just really began this year,
KGozOBtnqm NON-ARG 3512 3549 And so the infrastructure is one key.
xrXihsPewn NON-ARG 3550 3593 The second one is building the channel out.
AwvXAaLNtM NON-ARG 3594 3784 Unlike the U.S., as an example, where the carriers in the U.S. sell the vast majority of phones that are sold in the United States, in India the carriers in general sell virtually no phones.
rnjNClcMmp NON-ARG 3785 3859 And so it's out in retail, and retail is many, many different small shops.
vJDKoloSYF NON-ARG 3860 3957 And so we've been in the process â€“ it's not something that we just started in the last few weeks.
zuZkm4qmKA CLAIM-Other 2380 2470 And so when you think about upgrade cycles, upgrade cycles would have varying rates on it.
NFDZsLvlJU PREMISE-RealExample 2471 2602 As I talked about it in the comments, the iPhone 6s upgrade rate is slightly higher than the iPhone 5s but lower than the iPhone 6.
UZ0G17rOP4 NON-ARG 2603 2689 But the other multiplier in that equation is obviously the size of the installed base.
nmk7AkbwH- PREMISE-Other 807 1021 Obviously, what is different and particularly as we look at it on a sequential basis coming out of the March quarter, we will have lots of leverage, and that obviously is going to have a negative impact on margins.
zk61V-Woif PREMISE-Other 1022 1110 And the other factor that's important to keep in mind is this different mix of products.
qrNBHzgfgQ CLAIM-Opinion(view) 749 806 The other dynamics that you've mentioned are still there.
MMiMn1kc5t CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3304 3375 and so we'll begin to see some really good networks coming on in India.
b220mROrDC CLAIM-Opinion(view) 3376 3511 That will unleash the power and capability of the iPhone in a way that an older network, a 2.5G or even some 3G networks, would not do.
