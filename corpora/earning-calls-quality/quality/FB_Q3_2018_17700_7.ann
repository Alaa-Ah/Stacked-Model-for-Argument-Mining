PlAbZQjT2g NON-ARG 846 856 All right.
8hj2ISjT2D NON-ARG 857 886 Ross, I'll start off on that.
4P98_Bix70 NON-ARG 889 1058 think the outlook that we're giving for Q4 deceleration is broadly consistent with the outlook that I gave last quarter with the benefit of a little bit more visibility.
lPtf6cMxvm NON-ARG 1059 1166 I'd just reiterate the points that I'd made in the earnings script around what's driving that deceleration.
uUG5y6yYAX NON-ARG 1167 1266 And as far as to how that plays into 2019, we're not providing a specific revenue outlook for 2019.
k_Y5TRShz8 PREMISE-Fact 1267 1384 We continue to see good growth opportunities across the platform on both Facebook and Instagram and feed and Stories.
ceuewjrNaG CLAIM-Fact 1385 1419 Those are going to be the drivers.
MDEeq_l83T NON-ARG 1603 1777 The same factors that I discussed impacting Q4 growth will likely continue to play out to some extent in 2019, but we've got a lot of good growth opportunities for next year.
Cx8PF2XMRD CLAIM-Fact 1800 1889 When you look at the Instagram Shopping experience, we're seeing some really nice growth.
RXc-31_Gw1 PREMISE-Statistic 1890 2038 We have 90 million people tap to reveal product tags and posts every month to learn more about them, and we're putting real investments behind this.
FBDgFoq6fF PREMISE-Fact 2039 2139 In Q3, we rolled out Shopping in Stories globally and began testing the Shopping Channel in Explore.
M3YF0n_cux CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2140 2183 And so, we think the opportunities are big.
eBt3AYlZcE PREMISE-Fact 2184 2284 As you think about commercial intent in Facebook versus Instagram, there's so much activity on both.
raGsrx-jag CLAIM-Reformulated 2531 2680 So there are places in Instagram like Fashion or like Shopping that have very high signal, and that gives us I think a very strong opportunity there.
GRKhRMrTBg PREMISE-Hypothesis 2285 2463 We think there's a lot of opportunity for people to have commercial intent, if not have it when they start, but develop it because they see things they're interested in, in both.
gSrf0rNmtR PREMISE-Fact 2464 2530 Instagram can be more interest-based in some places than Facebook.
mKobkcx5HT CLAIM-Reformulated 1420 1602 I would characterize the launch of Status apps on WhatsApp as being a much smaller thing than a driver of 2019 revenue growth, and it's going to be more about Instagram and Facebook.
