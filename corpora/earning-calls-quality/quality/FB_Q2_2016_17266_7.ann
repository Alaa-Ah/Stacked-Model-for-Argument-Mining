rMJElQG7GB NON-ARG 478 530 Well, I, like everyone else, am enjoying Pokémon Go.
S_iqNnfnse CLAIM-Opinion(view) 531 858 And the biggest thing that I think we can take away from this as we invest in augmented reality in addition to virtual reality, is that the phone is probably going to be the mainstream consumer platform that a lot of these AR features first become mainstream rather than glasses form factor that people will wear on their face.
6wedxAn5BC PREMISE-Fact 859 985 So I think we're seeing this in a number of places, whether it's location through Pokémon or some of the face filter activity.

64rQZua5Hr PREMISE-Fact 1559 1727 And more of these augmented reality tools I think are going to be an important part of delivering that experience to making that fun to use and expressive as it can be.
30tvQBRvhs CLAIM-Fact 1745 1909 And, Mark, we've talked about our strategy on how we go about monetizing the different apps in our portfolio, and we usually talk about it in terms of three phases.
