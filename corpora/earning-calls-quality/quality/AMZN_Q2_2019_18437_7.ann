_JwwiJh4Q6 NON-ARG 662 667 Sure.
jpsc8Fnp1h NON-ARG 668 707 Let me start with that second question.
n2O71TZ_Ww CLAIM-Fact 708 969 So yes -- sorry, the operating margin in AWS, just like the revenue rate it's such a rapidly growing business with different timing of investments and global expansion in investment in marketing and other infrastructure that is going to vary quarter-to-quarter.
ZFxRDIu1C1 PREMISE-Fact 970 1123 We had a -- we've come off a period where if you remember last year we had less investment needed in infrastructure both for AWS and for Amazon in total.
bQ7fWTrwpG PREMISE-Statistic 1124 1381 The -- I don't have the number directly in front of me, but anyway we grew finance leases, which is essentially our props for capital leases for infrastructure by 9% in Q1 and it was 10% all of last year coming off a year in 2017 where we had growth of 69%.
B7oh9oN5EF PREMISE-Fact 1382 1405 So we had that dynamic.
heKIa8hwHy PREMISE-Statistic 1406 1466 Our trailing 12-month growth in that number is 21% after Q2.
LrJo3upP49 PREMISE-Statistic 1467 1501 So it's stepped up from 9% to 21%.
_IFR_a6DmE CLAIM-Fact 1502 1638 So we are starting to see as I mentioned in earlier calls that the investment will be stepping up in 2019, so started to see that in Q2.
4WCR4oLb5z PREMISE-Fact 1639 1877 But the biggest, I would say the biggest impact in this operating profit was the addition of sales and marketing personnel in AWS and also to a lesser extent the stock-based compensation, which certainly hits across all of our businesses.
XlZUpUoMct CLAIM-Fact 1878 2044 Your comment on revenue growth differential, I mean there's so many different factors going on in every country that's hard to compare North America to international.
lvSWdx596Q CLAIM-Fact 2045 2208 But I would say that we are attributing a good bit of the revenue growth acceleration from 17% in Q1 to 20% in Q2 to the rollout of one-day and the impact of that.
R0bF2V3C9R CLAIM-Fact 2209 2460 If there's other things, obviously, we continue to add selection and we have again lots of engagement points of customers through Prime Benefits and video and devices that certainly contribute to our revenue run rate in our retention of Prime members.
gQbMtwKZhz CLAIM-Fact 2461 2633 But if we're going to point to one thing in Q1 that's different -- Q2 excuse me, that's different it was obviously the start of the -- and the step up in one-day shipments.
