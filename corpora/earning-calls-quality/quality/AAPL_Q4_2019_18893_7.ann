9LmkCHGxT1 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 688 882 Yes, we had a very good September, Shannon, and the lead of that is sort of the reception of iPhone 11 and 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max, and so we feel really good about how we've gotten started there.
MM1pta1K6U CLAIM-Fact 883 978 As you can tell from the numbers, we've significantly improved since the beginning of the year.

JGGivNJUes PREMISE-Statistic 1045 1114 And if you looked at that in constant currency, we actually grew one.
ySS_TjvFVC CLAIM-Reformulated 1115 1158 And so there is a very slight growth there.
nx8YNGKSHK CLAIM-Fact 1159 1195 We obviously want that to be better.
wlUlZIxWvL CLAIM-Reformulated 1196 1235 But we feel good about how we're doing.
E-Ji7iLLRH CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1235 1314 I think it's a combination of things that are - that have turned things around.
HaCy38Pgh6 CLAIM-Opinion(view) 1315 1464 On a macro basis, I think the trade tension is less and that clearly looks positive right now with the comments that we've been reading in the press.
nS6LY0nwRJ CLAIM-Fact 1464 1527 Secondly, the products have been extremely well received there.
5dwrvEP2mW CLAIM-Fact 1528 1715 Third, the things that we've done from a pricing and monthly payments point of view and trade-in, getting the trade-in program up and running, all of these things have had moved the dial.
2Yi2jEN8d8 CLAIM-Reformulated 1716 1759 And so it's sort of the sum of all of that.
xpzA9ZCHMK CLAIM-Fact 2498 2559 Well, you know, Shannon, we've gone through different cycles.
xnC_tXyR7t PREMISE-Fact 2560 2618 In some cases, our revenue growth exceeds our OpEx growth.

5HGcREk9qu CLAIM-Fact 2733 2767 We want to invest in the business.
xv7kFl05CY CLAIM-Fact 2767 2951 Our primary investments during the last few years have been in the R&D space, because obviously we want to continue to innovate, improve the user experience differentiate our products.
tzyokyPlQi CLAIM-Fact 2951 2983 We continue to run SG&A tightly.

nyieN3rDx_ CLAIM-Fact 1850 1946 We began to see more gaming approvals in the quarter, or I should say some key gaming approvals.

44jGZglME3 NON-ARG 3558 3577 Thank you, Shannon.
OD2BVztYIY NON-ARG 3578 3617 Could we have the next question please?
9TNKgyoV09 PREMISE-Fact 3153 3542 And when we do that we need to make the adequate investments in marketing and advertising to raise the awareness of the new products and new services and that is what you're seeing for example in the guidance that we provided for the first quarter as weâ€™re launching new services right now, and so we're making investments both in engineering and in advertising to support the new launches
