So, for the video tab, the goal that we have for the product experience is to make it so that when people want to watch videos or they want to keep up to date on what's going on with their favorite show or what's going on with the public figure that they want to follow, that they can come to Facebook and go to a place knowing that that's going to show them all the content that they're interested in. So that's a pretty different intent than how people come to Facebook today. Today, for the most part, people pull Facebook out when they have a few minutes, when they want to catch up and see what's going on in the world with their friends and in the news and everything that's going on. That's very different from saying, hey, I want to watch video content now. And that's what I think we're going to unlock with this tab. So, all of the content that is on Facebook is eligible to go in the tab. I mean, we're showing video content, not all the rest of it, but there isn't a concrete difference between what can be a News Feed and what can be here. It's just that the experience is designed to deliver on that promise of, you want to watch videos, you want to keep up with the content that you watch episodically week-over-week, this is going to the place where you go to do that. I do think that it's going to get a lot stronger once the business model really starts to click here, right? Because a lot of the best episodic content is professionally created, and those folks need to make a good amount of money in order to support their business model. So having mid-roll ads, we're committed to doing this in a way that's very good on the user experience, but that is going to enable the kind of content that I think is going to take us to the next level. The early trends are good, but I think this is really going to be an area that is proportional to the amount of quality content that is in the system, and the business model is really going to be the thing that enables that. All right. Sorry. I forgot about that for a second. All right. So VR and AR, what can accelerate that? I think that there are parts of this that are on a good trajectory and parts where we're a little behind where we would want to be. I think Samsung shipping 5 million Gear VRs. I mean, that's their product, not ours, but we build technology that powers it. I think that's quite a good result, right, and one that we're very happy with, and just shows how strong of a company Samsung is at being able to build these products and sell them through into the world. On the side of the products that we built, Rift and Touch were both a little delayed, so that was obviously somewhat of a disappointment. And if you want to accelerate development, obviously, we need to get our products in the market at a good pace. But in terms of the content development, I actually think that that's coming at a reasonable clip. Early on, there is this issue, which is that if you're a AAA game developer, until there's a certain volume of units in the field, you're not going to be able to make enough money to fund your game development just based off of people buying your content. So that's why we're investing so much capital in content to feed the ecosystem and solve this chicken and egg problem if you need the content in order to create the ecosystem. But I don't think that there is really a strategy to pull this in from 10 years to five, I just think it's going to be a 10-year thing. The analogy that I always use is the first smartphones came out in 2003, right, the BlackBerry and Palm Treo, and it took 10 years to get to 1 billion units. And, I mean, I don't know if there was something that folks could have done to make that happen fast, but I think that was pretty good. And, I mean, if we can be on a similar trajectory of anywhere near 10 years for VR and AR, then I would feel very good about that, and I feel like we're making the right bets now to plant the seeds for that. But I would ask for the patience of the investor community in doing that because we're going to invest a lot in this, and it's not going to return or be really profitable for us for quite a while.", "start": 780, "labels": ["ANSWER"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 5028, "text": "Deborah Crawford", "start": 5011, "labels": ["REPRESENTATIVE"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}, {"type": "labels", "value": {"end": 5075, "text": ": Operator, we have time for one last question.", "start": 5029, "labels": ["ANSWER"]}, "origin": "manual", "to_name": "text", "from_name": "label-intro"}], "was_cancelled": false, "ground_truth": true, "created_at": "2022-02-04T10:03:51.603370Z", "updated_at": "2022-02-04T10:03:51.603375Z", "lead_time": null, "prediction": {}, "result_count": 0, "task": 17299, "parent_prediction": null, "parent_annotation": null}], "data": {"year": 2016, "company": "FB", "my_text": "\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt from Stifel.\nScott Devitt: Hi.
