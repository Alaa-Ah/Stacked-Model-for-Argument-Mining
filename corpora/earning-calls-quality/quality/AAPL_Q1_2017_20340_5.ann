k6pQCJsWMo NON-ARG 1149 1217 But I wanted to share that with you anyway so you have the backdrop.
C5MJXTyUVG NON-ARG 947 997 I share all this with you for transparency's sake.
PKEqmIlBHP NON-ARG 1757 1824 That's a big question, and I don't have the answer in front of me. 
8MIgL9QcJ1 NON-ARG 444 461 Simona, it's Tim.
ErZSyaVQMU CLAIM-Fact 462 661 We did have an exceptional quarter with iPhone, and that was with the backdrop of not predicting the demand very well on the iPhone 7 Plus and therefore being in constraint on it through the quarter.
Zqex9VsGFK CLAIM-Opinion(view) 998 1148 I would tell you that the way we look at this is in a quarter where you have a supply constraint, it's difficult to draw too many conclusions from it.
YlvEjcuIy6 NON-ARG 911 946 However, I think the big asterisk â€“
UpzlWglrgy PREMISE-Fact 662 761 If you look at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we've seen in any quarter.
1-0-sNYiqQ PREMISE-Fact 762 850 And if you look at the switcher number, it's the highest that we've seen in any quarter.
LyTLH2aAHT PREMISE-Fact 851 910 If you look at the upgrade rate, it's similar to last year.
sspFewSnZW CLAIM-Fact 1824 1909 If you look at iPhone 7 Plus, it was the most popular Plus model that we've ever had.
1BU7GD8XrD CLAIM-Opinion(view) 2037 2189 But sitting here today, for Q2, I wouldn't expect the year-over-year performance to be dramatically different than the year-over-year performance in Q1.
HtvyULh2X5 NON-ARG 1953 2036 In terms of how are we going to do, we don't provide guidance at the segment level.
wpOvpqbBDs NON-ARG 2190 2337 The real comp really begins in the following quarter to a more significant degree, and we'll have to see how that plays out as we get closer to it.
oEhU1IydC2 PREMISE-Fact 1910 1952 It set a unit record, so that I can share.
kCpRpklmEh NON-ARG 2390 2395  Yes.
