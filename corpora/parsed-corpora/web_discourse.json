In doing this, the DFID is following in the ideological footsteps of the World Bank. Indeed, a recent DFID Guidance Note on low-cost private schools argues that such schools have a key role to play in expanding education provision, despite acknowledging the fact that \u201cthere is still a lack of data and comparative analysis on education outcomes to assess value for money\u201d. This begs the question of whether or not is it a good use of public money from UK taxpayers to invest speculatively in for-profit private schools in poor countries? \nLow-cost private schools thrive in very particular contexts; for example, they flourish in illegal slum settlements in marginal urban areas, where governments fail to provide public schools because they do not recognise the settlements. Yet most slum dwellers would much prefer their governments to open schools. Low-cost private schools are also evident in other contexts: for example, where government services are largely absent, such as in rural Pakistan. Simple analysis shows that this is the result of the government failing to invest in education. Pakistan spends only 2.4% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on education against a benchmark of good practice of 6% of GDP. In this context DFID ought to be making the case for increased domestic investment, as it is the only sustainable solution."}, {"sent-class": "n", "sent-text": "UK aid is supposed to be focused on ending extreme poverty and support for low-cost private schools inherently contradicts this; instead, such schools actually exacerbate inequality.

For parents with four children, living on a dollar a day, paying $8 or more per child per month consumes more than their entire income. In such contexts, parents may choose to send just one child to the low-cost school; and usually boys are prioritised, thereby excluding girls and children with disabilities. DFID has found that: \u201cEvidence does suggest that there are serious equity and choice barriers associated with the growth of low cost private schools\u201d, yet, it seems that these concerns are not enough to stop new and further DFID investments. \nIn recent years, the biggest gains in education occurred when governments eliminated user fees to deliver on the right to education, leading to tens of millions of children enrolling in school for the first time, and supporting low-cost private schools mocks the importance of that evidence. A recent survey in Ghana found that of 450 children enrolled in low-cost, private schools, 449 were previously enrolled in government-subsidised schools \u2013 those schools that will now suffer as a result of poor investment.

A number of conservative Christian leaders frequently complain about the tragic injustice of how kids aren\u2019t allowed to pray in school anymore. \nThis is nonsense. Kids pray all the time in school (often right before a quiz or exam)."}, {"sent-class": "n", "sent-text": "And, in actual fact, no one is officially disallowing kids to pray in school whenever they want (so long as it isn\u2019t disruptive, of course \u2014 a basic school rule that equally applies to other sorts of free speech and forms of self-expression). \nHowever, please note that these constitutionally protected legal rights and freedoms apply only to people, and not to the government. Individuals may freely exercise their religion of choice, and give free expression to their own private religious preferences; however, the state cannot do likewise (because the U.S. Constitution also mandates that the state may not promote, endorse, or otherwise \u201cestablish\u201d religion)."}, {"sent-class": "n", "sent-text": "(They can\u2019t even offer to lead purely \u201cvoluntary\u201d prayers with an \u201copt out\u201d option for non-praying students; that\u2019s still a form of religious participation and support, on an official basis, by the state \u2014 which is flatly unconstitutional)."}, {"sent-class": "n", "sent-text": "It really is that simple.\nIt is sometimes objected that teachers\u2019 rights of religious expression and free speech are being violated, if they are forbidden to lead students in prayer. However, teachers on duty in public schools are not acting as private individuals, but as employees (and hence representatives) of the state. While acting in their capacity as employees of the state, public school teachers must comply by the constitutional rules that prevent the state from endorsing or promoting religion. \n(That also means that public school teachers may not post the Ten Commandments in their classrooms, or teach creationism in science classes, since doing so amounts to just as much of an unconstitutional state endorsement or promotion of religion as does leading students in classroom prayers.) \nSo, schools are by no means \u201cprayer free zones\u201d \u2014 the shrill objections of ultra-conservative Christians committed to the unconstitutional re-introduction of state-sanctioned, teacher-led daily school prayer notwithstanding. Just because school officials may not lead students in prayers does not mean that students are unable to freely pray on their own, throughout the day, at school. Students can (and do). \nIn the wake of violent school-related tragedies, such as the recent massacre at a Newtown, Connecticut public elementary school, there is often a wave of heated rhetoric emanating from religious conservatives regarding how perhaps such school shootings might not have occurred if only we had not \u201ckicked God out of our schools\u201d by banning state-led school prayer. But such reasoning is deeply flawed and fallacious on multiple levels. \nFirstly, we have not \u201ckicked God out of our schools.\u201d As private individuals, kids today remain as free to pray in their schools as they have ever been; in fact, their right to do so is constitutionally protected. It\u2019s just that it has been widely recognized that it is clearly unconstitutional for the state (and, by extension, state schools) to officially sanction, sponsor, offer, or conduct prayers. That in itself clearly does not transform schools into \u201cGod-free zones\u201d; banning schools from leading prayers, like banning schools from teaching religious doctrines such as creationism or posting religious rules such as the Ten Commandments, merely ensures that public schools remain religiously neutral environments, for students of every religion or no religion. \nSecondly, banning school prayer can in no way be seen as somehow rejecting or abandoning the alleged divine protection that schools would otherwise enjoy, as such theological criticisms always seem to intend to imply."}, {"sent-class": "p", "sent-text": "Public Schools are not allowed to teach religions which also teaches virtues."}, {"sent-class": "p", "sent-text": "Mine went to Public in Florida in Kindergarten and 1st and were coloring all day and playing computer games, and 1/2 the class did not speak English, in the same class!

This entire article is ridiculous. You are still allowed to pray in school as long as it doesn\u2019t affect the education that the school system is trying to give our children. You can pray quietly whenever you want and does the bible not say in: \nMatthew 6:5-8 \u201cAnd when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men. I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.\u201d \nYou can pray whenever you want. Church may also be a good time for that kind of stuff.\nYou cannot expect to hold up class time and such and force other people of other religions to listen to Christian prayers, Jewish prayers, Hindu, Muslim whatever it is not right to force people who do not share the same feelings about religion as you to sit there and listen to you pray is insensitive to the beliefs of others. You cannot be so ignorant to say that your religion no matter what it is, is the correct religion there is no proof that it is the correct one. If there was a correct religion and we knew about it then everyone would most likely be it, don\u2019t you think. Why are there so many religions in the world. Because no one knows what the right one is. Look at it this way. How many religions have been founded or made off the words of one man. All one man has to do is get people to follow him and how does he do that. He instills fear into people. People are always afraid. Always thinking of death and what could or won\u2019t happen next. Now if your scared enough and all of a sudden in what seems like coincidence, someone comes up to you and says hey you know what. I can save you I can save you from what\u2019s to come. But you must donate so that I can build a better platform to get the word out that I can save people you must help me you must donate and don\u2019t forget, don\u2019t do this \u2026 this and this\u2026 or else you will not go anywhere remotely nice when you die. You know this sort of thing gets to me when people think that they are right about they\u2019re religion or topics. Ignorance is truly bliss. Now in lieu of that last statement I am not saying that I am right in anyway shape or form. I believe that everyone should be allowed to believe whatever they want to believe and pray to whomever they want to pray. But what does bug me and what I do feel is unacceptable is when people try to impose they\u2019re religious beliefs FORCFULLY on someone else. Who do you think that you talking to a non-religious person is going to get them to change or believe what you believe. Last time I checked you were supposed to let God do that kind of work. You know about 60 % of religious people that I have personally met are hypocrites they preach about this and they preach about that and then once they are done putting on there Sunday best they go home drink a fifth and beat their kids. Now I understand that there is GOOD and BAD in everything. Not all religious folks are good people. Not all prisoners are bad people. Hell not all bad people are BAD people. Maybe just a bad choice or two has led them down a path that they did not intend to be on. I highly doubt most bad people as kids are thinking to themselves, \u201c You know what, when I grow up I don\u2019t want to be a fireman, I want to hurt people\u201d. That is the kind of thing that parents are supposed to be teaching their kids not to do. Parents are the ones that are supposed to be teaching they\u2019re kids values and morals and what is right and wrong. O\u2019 and side note all those parents that think that \u201cAngry Music & Video Games\u201d are the root of all evil and its what\u2019s causing your children to become evil and lash out at society. YOU ARE IDIOTS. I apologize, but your child may be playing violent video games and what not, but when they go out and rape or shoot someone. It will not be because of the video game it will be your lack of parenting, maybe you should have hit them those last few times. And if any of you are saying \u201cWell what about the belt?\u201d there is a difference between getting a belt to the butt and physically assaulting your child multiple times with your fists. \nSOCIETY SIDE NOTE: The reason that society is bad today is not because of the lack of Fear for God. It is because of what our society has become. Our society has become so concentrated on how people FEEL. That if someone is FEELING bad and they don\u2019t FEEL like going to work today then they don\u2019t. In today\u2019s society it has become acceptable to avoid all sense of responsibility. I know that more than half of you remember when you were young if you didn\u2019t do what your father told you, you were going to get the belt, and you know what you sure never made that mistake again. Now, you even show your child a belt with the intention of hitting him/her and your own child can sue you. People today are basically in my mind, for a lack of a better word soft. I remember my Grandfather telling stories of the horrible things that he was forced to do in WWII things that no one should ever have to go through, NO ONE (at 19 mind you). Yet you walk down the street or listen to the 18-24ish yr olds today and they are complaining about having to work more than 6 hours at a decently paying job. \nOk if anyone has actually read this entire thing I thank you for your time and I apologize if I have jumped around a lot."}, {"sent-class": "n", "sent-text": "If you want prayer forced send your child to a religious specific school."}, {"sent-class": "c", "sent-text": "But this holding them back because they are immature?

It seems that Khyra's last hope was that the local authority's home education support team might intervene once her mother had withdrawn her from school. \nThe principle seems straightforward \u2013 through registration, all home-educated children would become visible to the authorities, who could then protect them \u2013 and ensure that the education being received is adequate. \nBut Khyra was known to be at risk by the agencies whose job it was to protect her both before and after her withdrawal from school. The unpleasant fact is that parents who want to abuse children have ample opportunity wherever their children's education is taking place. The belief that children in school or being monitored out of school cannot be suffering abuse is sadly naive. \nFrom the home educators' point of view, however, the conflating of welfare issues with education is a dangerous step. It not only threatens educational freedom but also places a presumption of guilt on loving families who must prove themselves innocent to suspicious officialdom.

I vaguely remember some at primary school, but that was a CofE-run establishment so it's hardly surprising. I left school a dozen years ago. Assuming my experience was at least vaguely representative of the nation's, this is hardly a new situation. \nShould schools be forcing children to worship anyway? Parents seem to think not: an opinion poll commissioned by the BBC found that 60 per cent of adults do not support the enforcement of the law (that figure drops for older people, with more than 50 per cent of over-65s believing it should be upheld). It's a strange hangover from a time when Britain really was a majority Christian country. Now just 38 per cent of Britons, according to a 2005 poll, believe in \"a God\" of any kind (a further 40 per cent of people believe in \"some sort of spirit or life force\", apparently, showing that the market for new-age waffly nonsense is still going strong). Another poll in 2006 found that only 33 per cent of Britons describe themselves as \"religious\". Admittedly 71 per cent of respondents at the 2001 census described themselves as \"Christian\", but if most of those are not religious and don't believe in God, that's a pretty nominal affiliation."}, {"sent-class": "n", "sent-text": "It's in danger of becoming one of those joke laws, like the one that apparently says you can shoot a Welshman with a crossbow within the walls of Chester, and needs to be removed."}, {"sent-class": "p", "sent-text": "I send my kids to public schools because I care about them - their links with their diverse local community etc - but also because I care about the kind of culture they live in.

Early advocates of coeducation like Bronson Alcott were thought to be batty. \nPlenty of progressive educators and theorists have since laid to rest most of the traditional concerns and fears of coeducation skeptics.

I had never really thought what it might be like to work in an all-female environment, stuck firmly at the bottom of a ladder, and so my summers there were a revelation. \nNot the least part of the revelation involved my discovery that the young leaders of the camp, members of the first generation of late-20th-century feminists, were pretty serious about using the camp experience--sailing, biking, swimming, and lots of group activities--as leadership development. I also learned the hard way not to step into problem-solving roles until I was asked to, and I saw that younger campers idolized the competence of their counselors as much as they loved their warmth and enthusiasm. \nThe task of female role models and mentors was changing, and the staff was up to the work. I also discovered what \"collaborative leadership\" meant, as the administrative staff--led by a superb director not long out of college herself--talked things over and made decisions in ways that sounded way more like what Chris Argyris had been talking about in his myth-shattering Organizational Behavior course that year than the autocratic, just-follow-me style I had imbibed from television, movies, and high school. \nIf summers found me in a land of strong and independent women, my first three teaching jobs (my fourth has been in a decidedly coed environment) were back in a man's world. I think many of my generation of male teachers, with varying experiences navigating the waters of what the news magazines assured us was a Feminist Revolution, had been chastened more than a little on the meaning of masculinity and manhood, and so we did our best to tame our little corners of school environments that occasionally evoked Lord of the Flies; gently mocked as Sensitive New Age Guys, we tried to help our male students exchange bluster and boisterousness for an occasional listen and maybe even the occasional tear. I don't know how well it worked, but we felt we were doing our small part to win obscure battles in the most remote fields of that revolution. \nIn 2013, the world is decidedly different, and the battles are far less obscure. Colleges wrestle explicitly with how to combat \"rape culture,\" and events like the Steubenville trial generate national conversations around how our society fosters gender-role development. We celebrate the suddenly disproportionate success of girls in the conventional academic realm (they do so much better in high school that they disadvantage one another when it comes to competitive college admission) while we wonder whether one of our unending culture wars is on boys . \nMost boys' schools have long since stopped selling themselves as bastions of male hegemony and cut-it-with-a-knife testosterone culture. Curricula increasingly include diverse viewpoints, and access to self and creativity are as much a part of boys' school programs as lacrosse and basketball; schools work hard to imbue students with more beneficent ideas of what it means to be male, with responsibilities and difference equal parts of the equation. Education for boys and young men is changing, and it's heartening, for example, to note that old-fashioned expressions of stereotypical maleness, like those caught on tape when Rutgers coach Mike Rice went off on his players, excite general shock and outrage. \nI just spent the better part of a day with the faculty of the all-girls Ellis School in Pittsburgh, where I was reminded of all the best aspects of my own education around gender and gender roles. Intentionally and explicitly working to turn out strong, capable, assertive women, Ellis--its heritage, its excellent teachers, and its visionary leadership--is all about helping girls find and build on their strengths and passions. Ellis makes no apologies for its commitment to the growth of girls and young women as a single-sex school, and its palpable ethos had me wishing I had a daughter to send there. \nThe survival of excellent girls' and boys' schools in just about every large community I can think of strikes me as testimony not to the enduring idea of separation of the sexes but rather to some very sophisticated evolving ideas of what it means to be a young woman or man."}, {"sent-class": "p", "sent-text": "And, some studies indicate that children who are redshirted also have higher use of special education services in elementary school and higher rates of behavioral problems in adolescence.

But, at this point he keeps up well with friends who are a year or more older, and prefers their company to kids who are a few months younger. In some ways being surrounded by older kids is much easier because they tend to be more prosocial and they model social skills from which Leo can benefit. Taken together, the risk of Leo becoming bored outweighs any concerns I have about him socially. This coming year of preschool instead of being in a traditional 3\u2032s classroom, he will be in a young 4\u2032s room that ranges from 3 1/2 to 4 1/2.

A new, and sound, study just revealed that is a lot less common than people perceive. Only about 4-5% of kids start kindergarten a year after their birth date allows. This number is lowest among low income African American children (1%), presumably because of the cost to the family to provide another year of childcare, and highest within communities with a mean household income of $100,000 or greater (7%).

Interestingly, teachers rate enthusiasm to learn, ability to follow directions, and attention span as the most important factors for kindergarten success, less so than actual academic knowledge (which parents tend to perceive as most important). \nGiven the research on the topic, if you have concerns about your child\u2019s behavior and that is why you are considering delaying them, this is important information that may signal your child would benefit from behavioral intervention, if not immediately than it is something to keep in mind as they progress through their early years of schooling."}, {"sent-class": "p", "sent-text": "We kept our middle child back one year.

However, the data behind these assertions is shaky at best. Diane Halpern, Professor of Psychology at Claremont McKenna College and former President of the American Psychological Association, wrote a particularly biting review of the pro single-sex education literature. Perhaps as a result of the pro single-sex education framing, the US has seen an increased interest in single-sex schooling in the last few decades. More private single-sex schools have emerged and even many public school districts have begun to experiment with single-sex programs or classrooms. \nAn important question that arises in consideration of public schooling, though, is if separate schooling is actually fair to all students. The racialized question of separate but equal in education was answered by Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. The Supreme Court ruled that separate but equal in regard to race is not actually equal at all. Should we expect gendered segregation of schooling to be any different?
