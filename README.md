# Stacked-Model-for-Argument-Mining

In this project, we tackle the argument identification task on two different public datasets (Student Essays and Web Discourse), following two approaches: a classical machine learning SVM and DistilBert-based one. 
Moreover, this project sheds light on a new direction for researchers in this domain, since we validate the principle of ensemble learning. In other words, we show that combining multiple approaches via a well stacked model would improve the system performance.
